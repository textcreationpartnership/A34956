         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Juſtification makes us a right unto Bleſſedneſſe,   whereto Faith in Chriſt is our title,   and workes of Love are our tenure:   (and theſe two are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.)   But workes of the Law are neither title nor te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure.   Paul exhorts to ſeverall holy duties.   He argues variouſly:   1. Gravely,   2. Severely,   3. Gently.

               <p>Galatia being a large Province of Aſia the leſſe,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Her Inhabi&EOLhyphen;tants{/NOTE --> was originally inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the Greekes: But afterward (ſome <hi>360</hi> yeares before Christ) was poſſeſſed by the Gaules or French, who quartering and mingling

At last the Jewes, whoſe manner was (being a populous Nation) to disperſe their Families into divers other Countries, ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſojourners or ſtrangers, in the chiefe Cities of Galatia, where they had their ſeverall Synagogues, as the French and Dutch in ſome Cities of England, have their proper Congregations.</p>

And thoſe Believers of Galatia, who came in unto the Faith, whether from the Jewes or from the Gentiles (for there came in from both) are in respect of their ſeverall Congregations, ſtiled by the Apostle, the Churches of Galatia, unto whom he directs this Epiſtle.</p>

               <head>2. The Occaſion.</head>
               <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Her fal&s;e Teachers.{/NOTE -->AFter Pauls finall departure from Galatia into other Countries, to plant and ſettle the Greeke and Latine Churches, there aroſe in the Congregations of Galatia certaine falſe Teachers; who by Birth and Nation were not Jewes, but Proſelytes or Strangers, who had lived among the Jewes in Judea, where by Religion they became Christians, and from thence travelled afterward into Galatia; amongst whom (it ſeemes by Eccleſiasticall Writers) Cerinthus was the leading man.</p>
               <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Their fal&s;e Doctrine.{/NOTE -->The falſe Doctrine taught by theſe, was, That unto Salvation, the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Jewiſh Law were neceſſary, especially that of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet heerewith they taught not, that Faith in Christ, and Holyneſſe of life, were either to bee rejected or neglected: But approving the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of theſe, they preſſed their inſufficiency; alledging, that Faith and Holyneſſe were not ſufficient and prevalent, to procure us a right, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and claime unto the Bleſſings promiſed in the Gospel, unleſſe to our Faith and Holyneſſe wee ſuper-added Circumciſion. Thus they framed a complyance of Christ with Moſes, to compound the Gospel with the Law; or rather if wee conſider the moment of the matter, to ſubstitute the Law instead of the Gospel; for both of them cannot ſubſiſt together.</p>
               <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Their Argu&EOLunhyphen;ments for it.{/NOTE -->The Arguments whereby they raiſed and maintained this Doctrine, were chiefely Calumnies against St. Paul; partly by extolling Peter, James, and John, as the chiefe Pillars of the Church, as Apoſtles ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Christ himſelfe, as Reſidentiaries of Jeruſalem in the Conſistory
<pb facs="tcp:62812:3"/>
of Christ; partly by disparaging Pauls Apostleſhip, and oppoſing the authority of the Apostles against his authority; as, that hee had not the authority of an Apostle, or if hee had any, it was but derivative onely from them, and therefore was inferiour to them; That hee was the onely man who oppoſed the Ceremonies of the Law, for the reſt of the Apoſtles allowed of them; (and indeede for a time they ſeemed to allow them, prudently concealing their minde in that point, leſt otherwiſe the Jewes of Judea, where they chiefly preached, being blindly zealous for the Law, ſhould have taken diſtaſt againſt the Gospel.) That hee in the poynt of Circumciſion was inconſtant and various; ſometime urging it, as hee did upon Timothy; and ſometime oppoſing it, as hee did in Titus.</p>
               <p>The Deſigne or end of this Doctrine was double. <hi>1.</hi>
                  <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Their de&EOLhyphen;&s;igne in it.{/NOTE --> That by this means theſe Teachers might render themſelves gratious amongſt the Jewes, who highly eſteemed the uſe of their ancient Lawes; and conſequently that heereby they might become capable of all Honours, Offices, Priviledges, and Commodities granted then to the Jewes in divers places. <hi>2.</hi> That heereby they might decline thoſe perſecutions and other inconveniences, whereto thoſe Chriſtians were ſubject, who profeſſed the purity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſtripped from the Jewiſh Ceremonies. For in thoſe times by the Civill Lawes of Rome, and by the Edicts of the Romane Emperours, the Jewes in all places enjoyed the free exerciſe of their Religion: But ſo did not the Chriſtians, who were every where vexed by all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers on all hands both by Jewes and Gentiles, as appeares throughout the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>

But his name of Paul he prefixeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Epiſtle, becauſe in thoſe times it was the cuſtome among moſt Nations, eſpecially the Romans, not to ſubſcribe their name under or after their Letters, but to preſcribe or prefixe it above or before them in the firſt place, as Princes doe in theſe times.</p>

For thus the Twelve were the Apoſtles of Chriſt; and thus was Chriſt himſelfe the Apoſtle of God: for of the Goſpel, Chriſt was the originall Founder, who by a miſſion immediate from his Father, layd the firſt ſtone for the foundation of it: and Chriſt in reſpect of his miſſion, is therefore called, Heb. 3.1. <hi>The Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſion.</hi>

                     <p>With good reaſon therefore Paul heere oppoſeth Chriſt unto man. <hi>q. d.</hi> I am no way inferiour to the reſt of the Apoſtles;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Pauls calling equall to the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, for the meanes,{/NOTE --> for as they for their preaching of the Goſpel, had not their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Miſſion by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, who firſt taught, and after ſent them forth: ſo I, for my part, to preach among the Gentiles, had my Inſtruction and Miſſion, not mediately by man, but immediatly by Chriſt, who immediately by himſelfe, revealed and taught the Goſpel unto me; and by himſelfe ſent me forth to preach it among the Gentils.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and the Au&EOLhyphen;thour.{/NOTE --> And as the reſt of the Apoſtles had the originall of their calling from God the Father, whoſe will it was, that they ſhould bee taught and ſent forth by Chriſt; ſo the originall author of my Apoſtleſhip is God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by whoſe will I am an Apoſtle of Chriſt.

In ſome of his Epiſtles,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}&s;ometime joyntly;{/NOTE --> he adjoynes ſome one of his fellow-Miniſters; as Soſthenes in the firſt to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Timothy in the ſecond: whom alſo he adjoynes in that to the Philippians, and in that to the Coloſſians. In ſome he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes two; as Silas and Timothy, in the firſt and ſecond to the Theſſalonians. But in this to the Galatians, he aſſumes not only one or two, but even all the Miniſters his Brethren, that were at that preſent abiding with him. Becauſe, as it ſeemeth,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and why &s;o?{/NOTE --> all of them would have their Judgement extant in this Epiſtle, that it might carry the greater weight and authority with it. Partly to ſhew their affection to the Galatians, but chiefly to declare their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Pauls doctrine; and to juſtifie it from that ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, wherewith the Judaizers and falſe Teachers had charged it.</p>
                     <p>What perſons theſe Brethren were, is neither expreſſed from any Scripture, nor to be collected from any ſolid reaſon. Yet if

we ſuppoſe that this Epiſtle was written from Rome, as the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of many ancient copies date it, and the conjectures of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men affirme it, then it ſeemes they were Romans, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their Nation, or at leaſt for their preſent reſidence.

For Galatià was not a City, but a large Country or Province, wherein were ſeverall Churches or Chriſtian Congregations, whereof, (as it ſeemeth) all, or the moſt part, were leavened and ſowred with Judaiſme, or the falſe doctrine of ſuper-adding the law of Moſes, unto the Goſpel of Chriſt. Whereupon Paul directs his Epiſtle, not to any one ſingle Church of them in particular, but to them all in generall: becauſe they were all equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>

                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The title of the Father{/NOTE -->Unto each of theſe divine perſons ſeverally, Paul attributes a peculiar dignity or title of honour. For unto the Father hee gives the title of God, in an eminent and tranſcendent ſenſe; becauſe the Father is the ſupreame and moſt high God, who of himſelfe hath ſoveraigne dominion and power over all things, &amp; over all perſons; and who of himſelfe is that perſon from whom all other perſons are deſcended.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}of Chri&s;t.{/NOTE --> And unto Chriſt he gives the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of our Lord; becauſe Chriſt is the perſon, to whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath communicated the univerſal dominion &amp; governement over all things and perſons, excepting one onely, who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelfe. For the Father hath ordained Chriſt in a peculiar manner to bee the Lord or head over his Church in all matters thereto pertaining. And heereby Chriſt in a peculiar relation unto us, becomes our Lord, in whom wee muſt believe and truſt, and whom wee muſt worſhip,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Yet neithers title exclude the others.{/NOTE --> ſerve, and obey. Yet it is not Pauls meaning to make theſe titles ſo peculiar to each perſon, as if Chriſt were not God, or as if the Father were not our Lord; for each perſon beares both theſe titles; but that when they are mentioned both together, theſe are the uſuall formes to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence them.</p>
                     <p>Hence from theſe two attributes, thus differenced and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto theſe two divine perſons, of God unto the Father, and of Lord unto Chriſt, and becauſe there is but one Father, and one Chriſt; therefore it is frequent with the Apoſtle Paul, to call the Father <hi>one God,</hi> and Chriſt <hi>one Lord.</hi> For although

God the Father, and our Lord Jeſus Christ;</hi> Becauſe there is but one perſon, who unto us hath that relation of God, which the Father hath; and but one perſon, who unto us hath that relation of Lord which Chriſt hath. Hence it is ſayd, 1 Cor. 8.5. <hi>For though there bee, that are called Gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth, as there bee Gods many, and Lords many: But to us there is but one God, the Father of whom are all things, and wee for him; and one Lord Jeſus Christ, by whom are all things, and wee by him.</hi>

                     <p>Hence alſo it appeares that the divine ſervice of invocation or prayers is due unto Chriſt.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Invocation is due to Chri&s;t,{/NOTE --> Becauſe this ſalutation heere is an invocation (though indirectly framed) wherein Paul prayes for grace and peace unto the Galatians from God and from Chriſt. For Chriſt (as it is evident from theſe words,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the Ground thereof,{/NOTE --> and from the like in other places, wherein the government and care of Gods Church is aſcribed unto him) doth know the wants and the deſires of the faithfull, and therefore alſo doth heare their votes and prayers. Now the knowledge and the audience of ſuch things is a ground ſufficient for invocation or prayer to bee made unto Chriſt; eſpecially ſeeing his knowledge and audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are ſeconded with a power and a will, whereby hee is able and ready to helpe and to ſave thoſe Believers who call upon him. Hence Chriſt commands his Diſciples to pray in his name,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the Com&EOLhyphen;mand of it,{/NOTE --> and promiſeth to effect their prayer, John 14.13. <hi>Whatſoever yee ſhall aske in my name, that will I doe, that the Father may bee glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Sonne; If yee ſhall aske any thing in my name, I will doe it.</hi> This Invocation was preached by Steven, when hee was ſtoned,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and Practice of it.{/NOTE --> Act. 7.59. <hi>And they ſtoned Stephen, calling and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi> And practiſed by Paul, when there was given him a thorne in the fleſh, 2 Cor. 12.8. <hi>For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</hi>

theſe three things, <hi>viz.</hi> the Death of Chriſt, the Remiſſion of our ſinnes, and our Repentance, are conſequent, ſuitable, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laſt Will and Teſtament of God, wherein theſe things were thus ordayned.

Yet ſo as the latter is an end or effect ſubordinate to the former, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it: for our ſins are remitted or forgiven to this end, and upon this condition, that wee ſhould Repent and forſake them. And unto theſe finall cauſes, is annexed the efficient cauſe of Chriſts death; that it was not meerely according to the will of the Jewes, who put him to death; but it was according to the will of God, who in his laſt Will and Teſtament had decreed his death, for the ends and effects heere ſpecified. By all which he would intimate unto the Galatians, that for their ſalvation, they were not to adhere unto Moſes, and to the Ceremonies of the Law according to Gods old teſtament; but muſt depend upon Chriſt, and the benefits by his death, according to Gods laſt Wil and Teſtament.

And that word is Remiſſion or forgiveneſſe; that Chriſt gave himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, for the remiſſion or forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes. So the word Remiſſion muſt be underſtood, Rom. 4.25. <hi>who was delivered for our offences. i. e.</hi> Was delivered unto death, for the remiſſion or forgiveneſſe of our offences; for this ſenſe is declared by the words immediatly following, <hi>and roſe againe for our juſtification.</hi> And 1.

                        <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}&s;ometime expre&s;&s;ed,{/NOTE --> is mentioned expreſly.

                     <p>Yet Chriſt did not take the puniſhment of our ſinnes upon

himſelfe, to beare and ſuffer in himſelfe the puniſhment due to us for our ſinnes; for he was not puniſhed in our ſtead for our ſinnes; but he only tooke away,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}but onely tooke and bare away the puni&s;h&EOLhyphen;ment from us,{/NOTE --> or bare away from us the puniſhment of them, without inflicting it upon himſelfe. The certainty of this truth for this ſenſe of theſe two words, <hi>taking and bearing,</hi> is taught us by Matthew; for when the Prophet had ſayd, Eſay 53.4. <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hath borne our griefes, and carried our ſorrowes;</hi> Matthew cites this upon the miracles of Chriſt, in healing all that were ſick, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matt. 8.17. <hi>Himſelfe tooke our infirmities, and bare our ſickeneſſes.</hi> Now in healing the ſicke,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}as hee tooke away &s;ick&EOLhyphen;ne&s;&s;es and di&s;ea&s;es.{/NOTE --> Chriſt did not ſo take their infirmities and beare their ſickneſſes, as to be infirme or ſicke himſelfe: but he only tooke away or bare away from the ſick their infirmities and ſickneſſes. For when a Phyſitian cureth a diſeaſe, he doth not take it unto himſelf, to be ſick of it himſelf; but he only takes it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Patient: So Chriſt in dying for our ſins took not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf the puniſhment of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to beare or ſuffer the puniſhment himſelf: but he only took away and bare away from us the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſins. And when by the meanes of the Phyſitian, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is taken from the Patient, it is not neceſſary it ſhould be layd on the Phyſitian, or on any body elſe; for it ſufficeth if the diſeaſe be aboliſhed: So when by the means of Chriſt, the puniſhment of ſin is taken away from ſinners, it is not neceſſary it ſhould bee layd upon Chriſt, or on any elſe; becauſe it is finally aboliſhed. For the puniſhment of ſin is eternall death, which is already aboliſhed in grant or promiſe, and ſhall be aboliſhed <hi>in eſse,</hi> at the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for death is the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Our ſinnes then are not the efficient cauſe of Chriſts death;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Chri&s;ts death cau&s;&EOLhyphen;eth{/NOTE --> for Chriſt died not to be puniſhed for them: but his death is an effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of the Remiſſion or forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes; for by the meanes of his death, the puniſhment of our ſinnes is taken away, or borne away. And conſequently, the Remiſſion of our ſinnes,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the forgive&EOLhyphen;ne&s;&s;e of our &s;innes,{/NOTE --> is a finall cauſe, end or effect of Chriſts death: yet not immediat or proximous, but a remote effect. For (as ſhall bee more largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 21.) the immediat or proximous finall cauſes, ends or effects of Chriſts death, were to teſtifie, to confirm, and to execute the laſt Will and Teſtament of God; whereof one article is the Remiſſion of our ſinnes, which by way of Legacy is therein deviſed or promiſed unto us. Chriſt then gave himſelfe to death for our ſinnes: partly becauſe by his death he teſtified and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the new Teſtament, wherein the right of Remiſſion of ſinnes is given us; for that Teſtament being confirmed, becomes of force; and we by meanes of our faith, have a preſent right to the future forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes. And partly becauſe through his death he was made perfect with power to execute that Teſtament, that

he might actually remit or forgive our ſinnes, by doing all ſuch acts whereby we might finally enjoy the benefit thereof, when hee ſhall rayſe us from death to give us the poſſeſſion of eternall life.</p>

                     <p>See heere the nature of true Repentance.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The nature of Repent&EOLhyphen;ance,{/NOTE --> Repentance is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from wickedneſſe.

Yet not from all ſin in every degree of it, as errours and frailties; for unto ſuch a Repentance as to bee wholly ſinleſſe, no ſinner ever yet did, or ever can attaine in this life. But it is a ſeparation from that degree of ſin which is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Repentance then is a liberty or freedome from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for when Chriſt by forgiving our wickedneſſe delivereth us from it, then he cauſeth our repentance: and when we by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking wickedneſſe are delivered from it, then are wee come to Repentance. Unto this Repentance many have attayned, and thereto every Beleever may and muſt attaine in this life,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}which is re&EOLhyphen;ally all one with holy&EOLhyphen;ne&s;&s;e.{/NOTE --> or elſe his faith is not effectuall unto ſalvation. And this Repentance is really one and the ſame thing with holineſſe, though betweene
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62812:14"/>
them there may bee ſome rationall differences, as the words in divers mens underſtandings may bee diverſly dilated or reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For holineſſe may bee in a perſon who never ſinned, as is that of God, of Chriſt, and of Angels: but when the ſubject of holineſſe is a perſon that was a ſinner, and the terme from whence it began was ſin, then ſuch holineſſe is repentance; and in this life the holineſſe of Beleevers is no other; although ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are diverſe degrees, wherein ſome far exceed others.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The Motive to it is our Forgivenes.{/NOTE -->The Motive unto repentance or holineſſe of life, or the cauſe that ſhould invite and draw us unto the workes worthy thereof, or (which is all one) the Means whereby Chriſt delivereth us from the evill or ſinfulneſſe of this preſent world, is the remiſſion or forgivenes of our ſinnes. For to what end or effect did Chriſt die for us? It was to this end, to teſtifie and confirme the New Teſtament, that it might be in force unto us, and that we might have a preſent right to the Legacies therein deviſed or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whereon one is the Remiſſion or forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes. And to what end or effect are our ſinnes forgiven? Certainly not to this; that thereupon we ſhould imagine Repentance or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be a thing impoſſible, or ſhould eſteeme good works not neceſſary, or ſhould differ from the evill men of this preſent world, in nothing but in our faith; taking liberty to live licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, without feare of puniſhment, that grace may abound, and God may have all the glory of it: as the falſe teachers among the Galatians (who beſides the faith of the Goſpel urged the works of the Law) conceived of Pauls doctrine, and in the next Chapter ver. 17. will object it againſt him. But the end or effect which the remiſſion of our ſinnes ſhould have upon us, is to move and draw us to Repentance or holineſſe of life. For Chriſt died or gave himſelfe for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, that hee might deliver us from that ſervitude of ſin, wherin the men of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world are enthralled. Now this deliverance is done only by Repentance: becauſe Repentance only doth ſeparate and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw us from the ſervice of ſin and wickednes.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}2 Rea&s;ons of it,{/NOTE --> And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes ſhould cauſe our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are two.</p>
                     <p n="1"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}1 Repen&EOLhyphen;tance is the purpo&s;e of Forgivenes.{/NOTE -->1. Becauſe the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes is granted us in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our repentance. It hath been the buſineſſe of Gods ſpirit in all ages to ſtruggle with man, and to draw him from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Under the Law God ordayned ſeverall puniſhments by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent death for it: but this was a baſe and ſervile way for Gods people to be kept in aw, only through feare: and it was a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, faulty, or weak way; becauſe thoſe penalties by death could not doe the deed, to deliver or withdraw men from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62812:14"/>
Under the Goſpel therefore God proceeds in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe, by reverſing all penalties, and granting a generall pardon for all ſinnes; to the end, that what the Law could not doe by way of feare, that the Goſpel might effect by reaſons of Gods love: that wee in thankfulneſſe for ſo great a bleſſing, might anſwer his love with our love, and therupon for his ſake might forſake the wayes of wickedneſſe. And God ſealed this Pardon with the bloud of Chriſt, that his love in not ſparing his own Son, and the love of Chriſt in laying downe his life for us, might the more endeare and engage us to the works of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and holineſſe. Unto which effect, what further means are there conducent, beſides the feare of God in puniſhing ſin, and the love of God in forgiving it?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe our Repentance or holineſſe is the condition wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes is to take effect.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}2 Repen&EOLhyphen;tance is the condition of it.{/NOTE --> Every Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by vertue of his beliefe or faith, hath a preſent right to the future forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes; and his preſent right to that forgiveneſſe is abſolute or ſimple without any condition. For his beliefe or faith is not the condition thereof, but the nomination whereby the Right of forgiveneſſe, and the reſt of the Legacies deviſed in Gods Will, are aſſigned unto him; for that and the reſt are ſetled upon all the faithfull, by their name of Beleevers. But the future fruition of that forgiveneſſe is conditionall; for it is limited or reſtrayned unto the condition of Repentance or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: for though all Beleevers have a preſent right to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of their ſins; yet only thoſe Beleevers who are penitent or holy ſhall enjoy the future benefit of that Right. By reaſon of which limitation, the benefit or effect of actuall forgiveneſſe is ſuſpended, untill the condition of holineſſe bee accompliſhed. Which condition being never performed, God ſtands no way engaged for the future, to forgive actually thoſe ſinnes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the forgiveneſſe whereof the Beleever had once a preſent Right.</p>
                     <p>Hence Chriſt makes our Forgiving of one another an adequate condition of Gods forgiving us; that if we forgive one another,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and an ade&EOLhyphen;quate condi&EOLhyphen;tion of it.{/NOTE --> (which act in us is a good degree of our repentance or holineſſe) then will God forgive us: but if we forgive not, God will not forgive us; what former promiſe ſoever he hath made, or what preſent right ſoever we have thereto: Matt. 6.14. <hi>If yee forgive men their trespaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you: but if yee forgive not men their trespaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your trespaſſes.</hi> If Gods forgiveneſſe heere mentioned be not conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, then muſt wee needs averre, that either there is no ſuch thing as a condition, or that hitherto the thing is not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62812:15"/>
what it meaneth. Likewiſe every time wee pray to God for forgiveneſſe, as Chriſt taught us to pray for it, we aske it upon this condition of forgiving others. <hi>Forgive us our trespaſſes, as we forgive them that trespaſſe againſt us.</hi> Or if on our part this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be not expreſſed; yet on Gods part it is alwayes implied and underſtood. But if in this life our ſinnes bee abſolutely and actually forgiven, there can bee no cauſe why wee ſhould dayly pray for their forgivenes: becauſe no man prayes for what he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hath and enjoyeth. But becauſe Gods promiſe to forgive us is conditionall, therefore we dayly pray, that God would finally performe his promiſe, upon our performance of the condition.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Examples of the former{/NOTE -->Heerupon it is, that Chriſt makes the forgivenes of ſinnes a Motive unto Repentance, in ſaying to the Cripple whom he had healed, John 5.14. <hi>Thou art now made whole, ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> Under the words, <hi>Thou art made whole,</hi> Chriſt comprehendeth the forgivenes of his ſinnes: becauſe the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forme of words wherewith Chriſt healed, was by ſaying, <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> Peter alſo preſſeth the ſame doctrine, that the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, ſhould make us to repent, or die to ſin, 1. Pet. 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelfe bare</hi> (or tooke away) <hi>our ſinnes in his owne body on the tree; that we being dead to ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſse.</hi> The word heere in the originall for <hi>dead,</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifie <hi>departed:</hi> but is elegantly Engliſhed <hi>dead:</hi> becauſe it is oppoſed to <hi>live,</hi> in the clauſe following: but eſpecially becauſe all the dead are departed; and therefore all that are dead to ſin, are departed from ſin; which makes the nature of repentance. And the woman who had beene a ſinner, did carefully put this doctrine in practice, and ſhewed us an example of it in her owne perſon; for ſhe upon the forgiveneſſe of her ſinnes, was thereby moved unto acts of holineſſe in the works of love; and becauſe her ſinnes were many, her love was ſo much the more, in waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wiping, in kiſſing and anointing the feet of Chriſt. And Chriſt afterward declared, that her motive to this great love, was the forgiveneſſe of her many ſinnes; adding withall this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Luke 7.47. <hi>To whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth little.</hi> From whence it followeth, that hee who loveth not, to him nothing is forgiven; or at leaſt the forgiveneſſe will come to nothing: becauſe if it. come to ſomething, it muſt needs come to ſome love.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Chri&s;t is to be Judge of our Repen&EOLhyphen;tance:{/NOTE -->And Chriſt muſt bee the Judge of the condition. For his office it is to examine the reality of it, whether it have beene truly performed, according to the precept of the New Teſtament, wherein the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes is promiſed. Becauſe Chriſt is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62812:15"/>
the ſole Executor of that Teſtament; and unto the Executor it belongeth to examine, judge, and allow the conditions of Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies conditionall, that accordingly hee may diſcharge them; for the diſcharge of Legacies lies alwayes upon the Executor. And at the day of judgement, when Chriſt ſhall ſit Judge of the quicke and the dead, hee will alſo diſcuſſe the condition of our repentance or holyneſſe, judging thereof by the workes of love, in giving meate to the hungry, drinke to the thirſty, clothing to the naked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is largely deſcribed, Mat. 25.35. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly hee will frame the finall ſentence, either for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes unto the inheritance of everlaſting life; or for the retention of ſinnes unto the puniſhment of eternall death. Yet Chriſt will not examine the condition of our repentance or holyneſſe by the Rules of ſeverity and rigour, but of grace,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Yet he will judge of it in mercy.{/NOTE --> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and kindneſſe, accepting and allowing of a competent holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a meane degree, though it have not beene preciſely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.

                     <p>Thus Remiſſion of ſinnes and Repentance are of ſuch neare relation, that they goe hand in hand,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The Alliance between re&EOLhyphen;mi&s;&s;ion and Repenta&cmbAbbrStroke;ce.{/NOTE --> as the bleſſing and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it; being in ſeverall paſſages of the New Teſtament, joyned and coupled together as the two maine poynts or ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls thereof; and as the two maine ſubjects which make up the worke of preaching the Goſpel. For the New Teſtament being commonly diſtributed into the two maine branches of Promiſes and Precepts, or (which is all one) of Legacies and conditions; remiſſion of ſinnes is many times put for all the promiſes or legacies, and repentance for all the precepts or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Hence theſe two made up the preaching of John the Baptiſt, Luk. 3.3. <hi>And hee came into all the Countrey about Jordan, preaching the Baptiſme of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> Hence theſe two made up the ſumme of that Goſpel, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were to preach in the name of Chriſt, Luk. 24.46. <hi>And Christ ſayd unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhould bee preached in his Name among all Nations.</hi> Hence for the execution and effecting of theſe two, Chriſt was exalted to bee a Prince and a Saviour, Act. 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to bee a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi>

20. and Ezech. 36.27.28. and 2. Cor. 3.3. and Heb. 8.10.

And as for Paul, the action of calling is no where in Scripture aſcribed unto him, nor to any other of the Apoſtles: And it ſeemes ſomewhat too much for Paul, to ſay of himſelfe, that the Galatians were removed from him, or from his Goſpel, unto another Goſpel; for the Goſpel is really and truely the Goſpel of God and of Chriſt, and is conſtantly ſo called; albeit in ſome paſſages, Paul in reference to his Miniſtery and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, calleth it his Goſpel.

the ſubject thereof, which is the New Covenant, is called the Goſpel and the Covenant of Grace, and in that Evangelicall ſenſe, wherein the word ſtands in this place, (for to take the word in the whole latitude would bee tedious and needeleſſe) Grace is the will and act of God, whereby wee are made the ſonnes of God, and co-heires with Chriſt to the Inheritance of Bleſſedneſſe.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}oppo&s;ed to Nature,{/NOTE --> For hence Grace is oppoſed to Nature, which is an act of God, whereby wee are made men, to have an earthly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and inheritance after the Image or likeneſſe of God: So Grace is an Act of God, whereby wee are made Chriſtians to have an Heavenly Dominion and Inheritance after the Image and Likeneſſe of Chriſt, who was the naturall ſonne of God, borne to that Inheritance whereto wee after his likeneſſe as co-heires with him, are adopted.

And laſtly, hence Gods grace is oppoſed contrarily to his wrath and his Law; extreamely contrary to his wrath, and meanely to his Law; becauſe Gods Law is a meane betweene the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames of his grace and his wrath; for when God doth us more good or leſſe evill then his Law allowes, this is grace; but when hee doth us more evill or leſſe good then his Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, this is wrath; and his wrath hee many times executes upon us, by taking judgement into his owne hands, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſinnes by himſelfe, when the Ruler is negligent of his duty, in laying upon us the puniſhment aſſigned by Law; and extreame grace is, when God without any Law or equity obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him thereto, beſtowes upon us the ſupreame favour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us his ſonnes and co-heires with Chriſt unto the Inheritance of eternall Bleſſedneſſe.

Theſſ. 2.15. The meaning of the Apoſtle in this place, is not ſimply to ſay, that hee neyther recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor was taught the Goſpel at all: for in the words next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, he acknowledgeth and confeſſeth, that hee received and was taught it of Chriſt by revelation; for that was the maine point, which as he ſayd in the former verſe, he would certifie or make knowne unto the Galatians. But his purpoſe is to prove, that his knowledge in the divine Goſpel of Chriſt was not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; that hee neyther received nor was taught his knowledge

therein, by any Apoſtle, nor by any other mortall man. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Goſpel which Paul preached, were for the matter of it divine, as being the ſame which Peter and the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preached: Yet his knowledge therein, for the meanes whereby hee had it, might by the falſe Teachers bee alleadged and pretended to bee humane; which Paul heere denyes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But hee denies it not of Timothy, who though hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched that Goſpel which was divine, yet Timothies knowledge in that divine Goſpel was humane; becauſe hee received and was taught his knowledge therein by Paul who was a mortall man; for Paul both inſtructed Timothy in the Goſpel, and ordained him a Miniſter thereof by the impoſition of his hands. See and compare 1. Tim, 4.6.14. and 1. Tim. 6.20. and 2. Tim. 1.6.13.14. and 2. Tim. 3.14. So is it in all the Miniſters of the Goſpel at this day; for although the Goſpel which they preach bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, yet their knowledge therein is humane, becauſe they receive their knowledge by humane meanes.</p>

                        <hi>But by the Revelation of Jeſus Christ.]</hi> A ſuper-reaſon or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his former reaſon, by an argument drawne from the contrary, that the Goſpel which hee preached, hee neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nor was taught it by man; becauſe hee received and was taught it of Chriſt by Revelation. And heere againe Chriſt is oppoſed to man; not that Chriſt was no way man; but becauſe when hee revealed the Goſpel unto Paul, hee was not at that time a mortall man, nor at any time a meere man, but alwayes both God and man. And heereby alſo hee firmely concludes and proves his principall aſſertion, that the Goſpel which hee preached was not humane, or not after man; for if hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and was taught it by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, then certainely the Goſpell ſo by Chriſt revealed unto him, was no humane invention, neither was his knowledge in it by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inſtruction. <hi>q. d.</hi> For my knowledge in the Goſpel which I preached unto you; I was no Diſciple nor Auditor to any of the Apoſtles, nor to any other mortall man, to bee taught it, and learne it from man; but my onely Maſter and Teacher in the Goſpel was Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe, who revealed it unto mee; and his Revelation of it unto mee, was not after an ordinary manner as hee taught it his Apoſtles, and the reſt of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, while hee converſed upon Earth: But after an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and miraculous manner; for hee taught it mee ſince his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, and revealed it unto mee from Heaven; and this was the ground why I told you before; that if an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould preach any other Goſpel unto you, hee was to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed; becauſe thereby hee preacheth a Goſpell repugnant to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62812:28"/>
that Goſpel, which was revealed by Chriſt from Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Hee uſeth the word Revelation;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}By way of Revelation.{/NOTE --> becauſe Revelation is an inſtruction teaching peculiar and proper to the Goſpel, and ſuch an inſtruction as is alſo peculiar and proper to God to bee made by him; for although men have and doe teach the Goſpel; yet the action of revealing the Goſpel is never aſcribed unto man, but only unto God. See Mat. 16.17. and Luke 10.21. and 1. Cor. 2.10. and Epheſ. 3.3. and Phil. 3.15. For the Goſpel and the points therein contained are the ſacred myſteries and ſecrets of God, which of themſelves are veiled and covered from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man, who by the courſe of nature, or by force of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall underſtanding can never attaine to any knowledge therein, unleſſe firſt they bee revealed and diſcovered by God: Becauſe God, and God onely is the revealer of ſecrets. Dan. 2.47. The firſt Teacher of the Goſpel who publiſhed the Doctrine of it, was Chriſt, who becauſe hee was God, was therefore a Revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of it, and his Inſtruction was Revelation: But ſince Chriſts aſcention, his Apoſtles and their Succeſſours have beene Teachers thereof, yet not Revealers; neither is their inſtruction Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe Revelation is that inſtruction which is immediate or proximous from God; therefore the Inſtruction in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which Paul received immediately and proximouſly from Chriſt, who is God, hee calls it Revelation.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}At what time.{/NOTE --> But the time when Paul had this Revelation from Chriſt, can not bee certainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined from Scripture: Yet probable it is, that hee had it at the time of his converſion, when hee lay at Damaſcus in a Trance three dayes together blinde and faſting, without ſight or meat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when in his aſtoniſhment, hee demanded of Chriſt, what hee would have him to doe? Chriſt anſwered, hee muſt goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Damaſcus, and there it ſhould bee told him what hee muſt doe. Act. 9.6.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And probable alſo it is; that hee had this Revelation, at the time of thoſe Revelations, which hee had in his rapture when hee was caught up into Paradice, and heard unſpeakeable words; whereof hee writes, 2. Cor. 12.1.2.3. becauſe it is very probable that his trance after his converſion and his rapture for thoſe Revelations were at one and the ſame time; for in the ſequele of this Chapter hee drawes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Arguments from his converſion to prove hee was taught by Revelation: But this is certaine, that Paul never preached the Goſpel of Chriſt, untill firſt hee was taught it by Chriſt; and then immediately hee preached it.

But the tearme of Receſſe from whence hee was decreed to bee ſeparate, was partly his contemporaries whom hee exceeded in the acts of Perſecution, and partly the reſt of the Apoſtles whom hee exceeded in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Perſecution.

Acts 9.15. and as Ananias reports it unto Paul when he healed him, Acts 22.13.14. And unto this he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted at Jeruſalem, when hee was in a trance, praying in the Temple, where God ſayd unto him, Make haſte and get thee quickly out of Jeruſalem, for I will ſend thee farre hence unto the Gentiles.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and after&EOLhyphen;ward actu&EOLhyphen;ally ordain&EOLhyphen;ed.{/NOTE --> Act. 22.17.18.21. And unto this he was ordayned at Antioch, when unto the Prophets and Teachers there, as they miniſtred to the Lord and faſted, the holy Ghoſt ſayd, Separate mee Barnabas and Saul for the worke whereunto I have called them. Act. 13.2. For heer and now, at this time and place, that Separation was actually ordayned or deſtinated, which from his mothers wombe was pre-ordayned or predeſtinated. Hence Paul ſtiles himſelfe the ſeparate Apoſtle unto the Goſpel. Rom. 1.1. And hence he profeſſeth with a deepe aſſeveration, that hee was ordayned and appointed a Preacher, and an Apoſtle, and a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Gentiles. See 1. Tim. 2.7. and 2.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62812:32"/>
for the actuall execution of that whereto from my Mothers wombe hee had ſeparated and deſigned mee. This hee ſaith;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Pauls whole Apo&s;tle&s;hip Divine.{/NOTE --> to certifie and make knowne unto the Galatians, that his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe was no way humane, that hee had neither inſtruction nor authority thereto from thoſe that were the chiefe Apoſtles, as the falſe Teachers among the Galatians had falſely ſuggeſted: But the whole frame of his Apoſtleſhippe was wholly divine, from the good pleaſure of God even from his mothers wombe.</p>
                     <p>And in his expreſſion heereof, hee ſeemes to allude to the words of Eſay, who ſaith of himſelfe; The Lord hath called mee from the wombe, from the bowells of my Mother hath hee made mention of my name, Eſay. 49.1. Or to the words of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy, to whom God ſaith, Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee, and before thou cameſt forth out of the wombe, I ſanctified thee, and I ordained thee a Prophet unto the Nations, Jer. 1.5. In the words to Jeremy, to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> is the ſame,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Sanctifying put for &s;epa&EOLhyphen;rating.{/NOTE --> that to <hi>ſeparate</hi> is with Paul; for to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> there, is not to make Jeremy holy and righteous morally, but politically to deſigne and ordain him to a publick Office; for there Jeremy is <hi>ordained</hi> a Prophet unto the Nations, and heere Paul is <hi>ſeparated</hi> a Preacher unto the Gentiles. A ſaying not much unlike to this of himſelfe, and to thoſe of the Prophets, the Apoſtle hath of Jacob and Eſau, concerning whom God made a ſingular appoyntment from their Mothers wombe, while the Children were not yet borne, neither had done any good or evill, Rom. 9.11. But from Gods ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar acts upon any of theſe ſingle perſons from their Mothers wombe, to collect an univerſall appoyntment upon all ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from all eternity, is not conſequent by any rule of ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

If wee referre this Calling to the time of his Mothers wombe, and make it an adjunct and concurrent with his ſeparation, as if from his Mothers wombe God had both ſeparated and called him; then the word <hi>called</hi> cannot ſignifie the act of his calling, that then hee was actually called, but onely the Decree of his calling, that then God deſigned him to bee called afterward; as it ſeemes the word is taken, Rom. 9.11. But there is no cauſe to the contrary, but that the word <hi>called</hi> may heere ſignifie the effect of that ſeparation which God made of him in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, and the time of it fitly referred to thoſe times wherein hee was actually and really called, by the intimation unto him of Gods will and pleaſure, who had elected, inſtituted, and ordained him to execute the office of an Apoſtle to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62812:33"/>
which intimation was made and confirmed unto him at ſeverall times and places, as at Damaſcus by Ananias, at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem by God himſelfe in a viſion, and at Antioch by the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The non-cau&s;es of it.{/NOTE --> as was formerly noted. And the ground of his <hi>Calling</hi> to bee an Apoſtle of Chriſt was no qualification in himſelfe, whereby hee was prepared or fitted to preach Chriſt: for hee was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of Chriſt, who now upon his <hi>calling</hi> was to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto him; as it appeares by the words next following: Nor no act of juſtice in God, whereby God was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence any former act done by Paul; who had done many acts to the contrary, that made him unworthy to bee called an Apoſtle; for although touching the righteouſneſſe which is in the Law, hee was blameleſſe, Phil. 3.6. Yet touching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, hee was not blameleſſe, but criminates himſelfe for a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a perſecutor, and injurious, 1. Tim. 1.13. Nor no act of equity in God, whereby God ſtood engaged to his owne decree, in ſeparating and deſigning him to the Apoſtleſhip from his Mothers wombe; for that decree being made ſeverall yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the act of his calling, had without all queſtion thereto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed ſuch conditions as were ſutable to the wiſdome and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God; as particularly this condition, that before his actuall calling hee ſhould not render himſelfe altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of ſo ſacred a Function; whereof hee made himſelfe unworthy in a manner, and enough to acquit God of his decree or deſigne; becauſe hee was a blaſphemer and a perſecutor, and had made himſelfe unworthy altogether, if hee had beene a blaſphemer wittingly and willfully againſt the knowledge and motion of his conſcience; for of ſuch a ſinne Chriſt affirmeth that it ſhall never bee forgiven, Mat. 12.32. And if ſuch a ſinne muſt never bee forgiven, much leſſe muſt the perſon polluted with ſuch a ſinne, bee called to a Function ſo ſacred; for if hee were not meete to <hi>bee called</hi> an Apoſtle, becauſe hee perſecuted the Church of God, as himſelfe argues, 1. Cor. 15.9. much leſſe had hee beene meete for it, if hee had perſecuted wittingly and willfully.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The true cau&s;es of it.{/NOTE --> But his calling to his Apoſtleſhip was an act of Gods meere <hi>grace</hi> proceeding from the good pleaſure of God: For as the Decree for his calling when hee was ſeparated from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, came out from the good pleaſure of God: So the act of his calling afterward had the ſame good pleaſure for the ground of it. Or as Paul tearmes it elſewhere, it was an act of Gods mercy, and Gods mercy is alſo his grace, ſeeing all mercy is grace; for although hee were a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, and injurious, yet hee obtained mercy, becauſe hee did it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly in unbeliefe, 1. Tim. 1.13. Whereby he tacitly intimates
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62812:33"/>
that hee had not obtained mercy, if hee had done it in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and malice. Yet Pauls ignorance was not the cauſe of that mercy, but onely the condition which qualified him for it; for the cauſe of it was, becauſe Chriſt had a purpoſe upon Paul to make him a patterne of his mercy and long-ſuffering to them which ſhould heereafter believe on him to life everlaſting, 1. Tim. 1.16. Pauls title then to his Apoſtleſhip was onely grace, and ſo wholly grace, that very frequently in his Epiſtles hee not onely denominates it from grace, but nominates and calls it grace. See and compare, Rom. 1.5. and Rom. 15.15.16. and 1. Cor. 3.10. and Gal. 2.9. and Epheſ. 3.7.8.</p>

Chriſt,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}by the meanes of Chri&s;t,{/NOTE --> revealed Chriſt and his Goſpel to Paul; or Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God revealed himſelfe and his Goſpel to Paul; for as ver. 1. hee had his Apoſtleſhip from God by Chriſt: ſo by theſe two verſes it appeares, that hee had his revelation from God by Chriſt. And therefore of this revelation unto Paul, God was the principall authour who appointed it, and Chriſt was both the Inſtrument and Matter of it, ſo that the iſſue comes to this,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}who is the Son of God,{/NOTE --> That God by Chriſt revealed Chriſt to Paul. Now Chriſt is called, and is the ſon of God, by way of ſingular eminency, as the article <hi>the</hi> declares unto us: becauſe he is ſo in a moſt pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and excellent maner, through ſeverall degrees of eminency, far beyond all other Men and Angels, who in ſome maner and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are alſo the ſons of God; for the Saints are the ſons of God by their juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into that ſon-hood, which unto Chriſt is naturall,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and a My&s;te&EOLhyphen;ry.{/NOTE --> and whence they are made coheirs with Chriſt. And Chriſt as the ſon of God is a myſtery, or a ſecret perſon, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of whom is veyled, covered, or hidden from the world; for Chriſt and his goſpel is called the myſtery of God, the myſtery of Gods will, and the myſtery which was kept ſecret ſince the world began. See Rom. 11.25. and Epheſ. 1.9. and Col. 4.3. Hence Chriſt eſpecially ſince he was crucified, is ſayd to be unto the Jewes a ſtumbling block, and unto the Greeks fooliſhneſſe: becauſe unto them both, hee was a myſtery veyled and covered from their knowledge. And this myſtery of Chriſt to bee the ſon of God, was not originally made known by any naturall means, from any mortall man, but was by God himſelfe, and by him only, firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and diſcovered: becauſe of God alone, it is the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and property to reveal ſecrets. And God revealed Chriſt to be his ſon, at ſeverall times, to ſeverall perſons; as unto John the Baptiſt, who bare record of Chriſt, that hee was the ſon of God: for God who ſent him to baptize, ſayd it unto him. John. 1.33.34. and unto the Apoſtles, by name unto Peter, who confeſſed Chriſt to be the ſon of the living God; for not fleſh and bloud, but God the Father revealed that unto him. Mat. 16.16.17.

But why hee choſe to preach the Goſpel there, rather then elſewhere, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62812:37"/>
reaſon might bee, becauſe Arabia was much remote and quite contrary to Cilicia, wherein ſtood the famous Tarſus, where Paul was borne, and well knowne, for hee was a Citizen of that City; but Arabia was as it were an Angle of the World, and a Country of obſcure and baſe condition, wherein hee might bee latitant in his preaching, and live ſomewhat ſecure from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that perſecution, which himſelfe had partly raiſed, and at that time flamed in all places round about Jeruſalem, from whence the Saints were then all ſcattered abroad, except the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles who there lay hid; for it was the manner of Paul, who himſelfe had beene a perſecutor, to bee alwayes ſubject to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and yet alwayes to ſhunne it by all the ſhifts hee could make, as farre as hee obtained licence and warrant from God. This journey of Paul from Damaſcus into Arabia is not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by Luke in the Acts of the Apoſtles; yet it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not a truth; but therefore it is a truth, becauſe Paul men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it heere; for whatſoever is any where mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a truth, and many a truth is no where mentioned, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in poynt of Hiſtory.</p>

The returne then of Paul from Arabia was not voluntary, free, and open; but neceſſary, wary, and ſecret by way of retire.

But why hee retyred back againe to Damaſcus,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and why &s;o?{/NOTE --> the reaſon is manifeſt from the Scripture; becauſe hee was to preach the

And there hee preached Chriſt till hee was perſecuted thence; for Damaſcus was a Gariſon-City, whoſe gates were watched day and night, where the Governour min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to apprehend Paul, and the Jewes layd wait to kill him; but by night hee was let downe by the wall in a basket, by meanes whereof hee eſcaped thence.

See afterward in this cap. ver. 21. and 1. Cor. 12.28. and 1. Cor. 15.6.7.23.46. and Heb. 7.2. When he was perſecuted from Damaſcus,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Pauls return to Jeru&s;alem{/NOTE --> the next City whereto hee came afterwards, was Jeruſalem; from whence hee had now beene abſent for the ſpace of three years. For the three yeares muſt not be computed from his retire out of Arabia unto Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcus, as if he had preached three yeares at Damaſcus; for how could he poſſibly preach ſo long in a City ſo populous, and ſo neer to Jeruſalem, with ſuch aſtoniſhment to all that heard him in then Preaching Chriſt, whom before he perſecuted? and yet all this while no report of his Converſion ſhould come to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem? Now that no certainty thereof came thither, is from hence evident: becauſe when at the end of three yeares Paul himſelfe returned to Jeruſalem, his preſent condition of being an Apoſtle was ſo unknowne to the Diſciples there, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved him not a Diſciple; and when hee aſſayed to joyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with them, they were all afrayd of him, as if he had yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted a perſecutor; untill he was neceſſitated to procure the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie of Barnabas to introduce him to the Apoſtles, and to make the report as well of his converſion to the fayth, as of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt at Damaſcus. See Act. 9.26.27. Hence it appeares, 1. That although his Preaching at Damaſcus were many dayes, as Luke expreſſeth the time of it, Act. 9.23. yet it laſted not for the ſpace of three yeares; and therefore the three yeares muſt be computed from the time of his converſion, or calling to his Apoſtleſhip; or, which comes all to one, from the time of his journey from Jeruſalem toward Damaſcus, becauſe his converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fell out in that journey. 2. That the greateſt part of the three years was ſpent in Preaching in Arabia; from whence the news of his converſion came not to Jeruſalem; eyther becauſe the Countrey of Arabia was ſomewhat obſcure, and farre remote from Jeruſalem, or becauſe all commerce and paſſage of Letters was ſtopped by reaſon of the perſecution then reigning about Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. <hi>I went up.</hi>

                     <p> AFter his abode at Jeruſalem for the ſpace of fifteen dayes, Partly becauſe of his danger from the Helleniſts, againſt whom he diſputed there; but chiefly in obedience to the viſion of Chriſt who commanded him away from thence, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thence and came into Syria. Yet unto Damaſcus, the chief City of Syria he returned not, by reaſon of the danger which not a month before he incurred and eſcaped there, from the inquiſition of the Governour, who ſought to apprehend him, and from the inſidiation of the Jewes, who layd wait to kill him: but he paſſed through the regions of Syria; that is, through the Shires, Countreys, or Countrey-parts of it; for through the regions of Syria he muſt needs paſſe: becauſe Syria lyes between Judea and Cilicia;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Paul travels to Tar&s;us,{/NOTE --> and in the direct way from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem to Tarſus, whither Pauls purpoſe was to travell, that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62812:40"/>
there for a time hee might reſide. And becauſe of the danger wherein hee was at Jeruſalem, where hee diſputed againſt the Helleniſts till they went about to kill him; therefore from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem the Brethren conducted him as far as Ceſarea, which ſtands upon the Confines of Syria; and at Ceſarea they tooke their leave, diſmiſſing him to paſſe forward toward Tarſus; as it is atteſted by Luke, Act. 9.30.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and why &s;o?{/NOTE --> The reaſon why hee travelled to Tarſus was, partly becauſe Tarſus was his Native City, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee was borne, Act. 22.3. But chiefely to preach the Goſpel there and in Cilicia, which was the Country thereto adjacent, and wherein hee planted the Goſpel; for upon the difference betweene Barnabas and him, hee made a viſitation through Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria and Cilicia to confirme the Churches, Act. 15.41. which confirmation doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe a former plantation.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and his a&EOLhyphen;bode there.{/NOTE --> At and about Tarſus hee made his abode for ſome good ſpace of time; for when Barnabas was ſent from Jeruſalem unto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, and departed from Antioch on purpoſe to ſeeke Paul, hee ſought for him at Tarſus, and there finding him, brought him from thence back to Antioch, Act. 11.25.26. Thus until his next journey to Jeruſalem with Titus about the Apoſtles De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, the places of his reſidence were Antioch and Tarſus, that is, Syria and Sylicia; for Antioch is a City of Syria, and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of Cilicia.

as it contayns the whole land of Iſrael, including Galily and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and as Judea is oppoſed to Syria and Cilicia. For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution at Jeruſalem ariſing upon the diſpute of Stephen with the Synagogue of the ſtrangers there, grew ſo fearful and bloudy, for divers were put to death, that the faithful were ſcattred all abroad not only throughout the Regions of Judea ſtrictly taken, but of Samaria alſo. Act. 8.1. And the good providence of God, by the ſcattering of the faithfull, ſcattered alſo the Goſpel; for they who from Jeruſalem were ſcattered abroad, went every where prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpel, Act. 8.4. Hence Philip, to whom Peter and John ſoone after adjoyned themſelves, planted the Goſpel in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and preached it in many Villages of the Samaritans, Act. 8.25. And after the baptiſme of the Eunuch, he preached in all the Cities of Samaria, till he came to Ceſarea, which frontiers upon Syria, Act. 8.40.

Yet Paul departing from Jeruſalem, makes not his addreſſe to any of the Churches in the Regions of Judea, Galilee, or Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, where hee might have reſted with ſafety and ſecurity, for it was now a time of tranquility from the tempeſt of the former perſecution: but he proceeds into the Regions of Syria and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia; becauſe unto the Churches of Judea, Galilee, and Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, he was altogether a ſtranger, unknowne by his bodily and perſonall preſence; neither the teachers, nor members of thoſe Churches had ever ſeen his face to his knowledge. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon heereof might be; becauſe in a maner Paul was a ſtranger in the Countreyes of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee: for he was then but a yong man, who was borne at Tarſus, and brought up at Jeruſalem, where he had alwayes lived, till about three yeers before, during which time he had preached in Arabia, and at Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus in Syria.</p>

Specially, and ſo to be in Chriſt, is to be a reall, ſincere, and true Chriſtian, in oppoſition to the hypocrite, the carnall and falſe Chriſtian: and he is a reall Chriſtian, who puts on Chriſt, and lives according to the life of Chriſt; who not only beleeves the verities of the new Covenant, and accepts the promiſes of it, but alſo obeyes the precepts of it, by being a new creature accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the new Covenant: for thus to doe and be, is to be in the ſpirit, and to have the ſpirit of Chriſt, which if any man have not, he is not in Chriſt.

But of his latter action in preaching the faith, the Churches of Judea for the ſpace of three yeares after hee began to preach it, heard not a word, or if they heard any thing thereof, they beleft it not; for when Paul (after three yeares of preaching the Goſpel in Arabia and Damaſcus) came from Damaſcus into Jeruſalem, neither the Churches of Judea, nor thoſe of Jeruſalem had heard of it; for the faithfull at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem were all afraid of him, and beleeved not that hee was a Chriſtian, as was ſhewed before, from Acts 9.26. But upon that returne of Paul to Jeruſalem, the Church of Jeruſalem firſt heard of his Preaching the Faith; and ſhe heard of it by Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas who brought Paul to the Apoſtles, and declared unto them both his calling and his Preaching, how wonderfully Chriſt had called him, and how powerfully he had Preached Chriſt at Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus. Act. 9.27. And from the Church of Jeruſalem, the Churches of Judea circumjacent, might eaſily heare the report of it.</p>

Paul before in this Chap. verſ. 13. ſaith to the Galatians that he had perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>the Church of God:</hi> and here he ſaith, that the Churches of Judea had heard of him, he which perſecuted <hi>us:</hi> yet between his ſaying and theirs, there is no difference concerning the object of his perſecution, or the perſons by him perſecuted, who in his ſaying and theirs are ſtill the ſame: becauſe the Churches of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea were the Churches of God; for they were particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that univerſall Church, which Paul in particular places perſecuted in times paſt. And very probable it is, that ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons either teachers or Members in thoſe Churches of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, were by Paul actually perſecuted, and forced from Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem upon the Martyrdome of Stephen; becauſe the times paſt were not long paſt, for it was but a matter of three yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And thoſe Saints which then were not at Jeruſalem, were notwithſtanding perſecuted in that perſecution; for as when one member of the body ſuffereth, all the members ſuffer with it: ſo when any one part of the Church is perſecuted, all the faithfull who are the members thereof, and Chriſt himſelfe who is the head thereof, is alſo perſecuted; for Chriſt complained, that in that very perſecution himſelfe was perſecuted; ſee Act. 9.5. Now the Apoſtle inculcates the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his former perſecution into the mindes of the Galatians, thereby to maintaine their perſwaſion of him, that ſo great a Zelot for the Law of Moſes, as therefore to perſecute the Church of Chriſt, had not caſt off his patronage of the Law, or layd aſide his malice againſt the Goſpel,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}hee was be&EOLhyphen;come a Prea&EOLhyphen;cher.{/NOTE --> without juſt and weighty cauſes.</p>

                        <hi>AND they glorified God.</hi>] The Churches of Judea hearing that Paul preached the Faith, did thereupon glorifie and praiſe God; for it was an ancient cuſtome among the people of God to give praiſe and thankes to God for any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary worke of God. See Mat. 9.8. and Mat. 15.31. and Luk. 7.16. and Acts 4.21. particularly upon the ſame of a ſinners repentance, or of any mans converſion to the faith, eſpecially if he had been a perſecutor of it; becauſe ſuch a converſion hath in it more then ordinary, and is an immediate worke of God. And ſuch was Pauls converſion, wherein the good grace of God was extreamly powerfull, by drawing him from one extreame to another; that is, from being a Perſecutor of the Faith, not only to the ſtate of a Beleever, but beyond that ſtate, to become a Preacher of it.</p>

Pauls converſion was a moſt memorable action, eſpecially unto Paul, and fit to ſtand for an epocha unto him, from whence hee had good cauſe to compute all the acts of his Miniſtery du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life; for all epochaes are fixed at a time of ſome nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble converſion in the World, that from thence in the memory thereof, future times may afterward bee computed. 2.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62812:47"/>
had his inſtructions in the doctrine of the Goſpel;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Paul much directed by Divine Re&EOLhyphen;velations,{/NOTE --> ſo by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo he had particular directions in many caſes for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Miniſtery. His departure from Jeruſalem after fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes abode there to ſee Peter, was from a viſion, wherein he ſaw the Lord ſaying unto him, Make haſte and get thee quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of Jeruſalem, Act. 22.18. His journey into Macedonia was from a viſion that appeared unto him in the night, Act. 16.9. His appeal to Rome was from the Lord, who ſtood by him in the night and encouraged him thereto, that hee might beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt at Rome, Act. 23.11. And this journey heere from Antioch to Jeruſalem was by revelation: and leſt through the abundance of his viſions and revelations he ſhould be exalted above meaſure, the Lord layd an affliction upon him, 2. Cor. 12.7. But viſions and revelations were not proper and peculiar to Paul only; for they were communicated and imparted unto the Apoſtles in generall, and unto ſome that were not Apoſtles; as unto Ananias and Cornelius.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}which did &s;ometime &s;econd a hu&EOLhyphen;mane deter&EOLhyphen;mination.{/NOTE --> See Act. 9.10. and Act. 10.3. Yet Pauls going to Jeruſalem by revelation, is nothing repugnant to his going by the will and decree of the Church of Antioch, as Luke relates the cauſe of his going, Act. 15.2. For by ſeverall and divers motives a man may be induced to one and the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; much more when there is a concurrence of Gods will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mans purpoſe; and very credible it is, that when the Church of Antioch had determined that Paul ſhould goe to Jeruſalem, then Paul was admoniſhed by a revelation from God, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that journey, which they had already determined upon him: becauſe Gods will is ſometime ſubſequent to follow not only mans will, but his act, by approving and confirming after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; what man before hath willed and acted: for hence Chriſt ſayd to his Diſciples, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall bee bound in heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven,</hi> Mat. 18.18. Now Paul mentions this Motive of his journey, that he went it by revelation, thereby to ſignifie that hee went then to Jeruſalem, chiefly as a Meſſenger ſent from God; leſt his adverſaries to diminiſh the authority of his Miniſtery, ſhould ſuggeſt to the Galatians, that Paul went that journey as a meere Meſſenger and ſervant to the Church of Antioch.</p>

To the chiefe perſons therefore of that Church, Paul related the ſumme of his Doctrine; for they were moſt concerned in the point, becauſe they were beſt able to examine it, and to give their judgement in it. And with theſe he firſt dealt privately at a ſecret meeting, as in like caſes commonly the maner is, before he communicated the matter to the whole Church of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, to whom the matter was referred, and to whom afterward Paul and Barnabas publickly delivered it in the Synod. For when in a full audience of the Synod they two had rendred an account of that Doctrine which they had preached among the Gentiles, and had declared the miracles and wonders which God by them had wrought among the Gentiles, preſently upon their ſilence James gave the ſentence, which was approved by the whole Synod, and thereupon the Decrees were drawne up, to be ſent abroad among the Gentiles, as Luke reports it, Acts 15.12, 13.

This his Apoſtleſhip hee calls a grace, becauſe the office thereof was conferred upon him from God by Chriſt, by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther title, then by the grace of God; as is further implyed in the word <hi>given:</hi> Becauſe all gifts of what nature ſoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the grace and favour of the giver. Paul of himſelfe was unſufficient for this Function; for hee was ignorant of the Goſpel, till ſuch time as it pleaſed God to reveale Chriſt unto him; and above all other men hee was unworthy of it, becauſe hee was a perſecutor of thoſe perſons who ſuſtained it, and of the Church, for whom the office was ordained. So that unto Paul his office in the Apoſtleſhip was free grace, becauſe hee no way deſired it, and meere grace becauſe hee no way deſerved it, and abundant grace becauſe hee deſerved the contrary. Hence elſewhere hee calls his Apoſtleſhip by the name, not onely of grace, but of grace exceeding abundant. See and compare Rom. 1.5. and Rom. 15.15. and 1. Tim. 1.14. But hee mentions it here by the name of grace, to continue his Argument for the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; for ſeeing the Goſpel was committed or entruſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſeeing God was mighty in it toward the Gentiles, and ſeeing it was a gift unto him proceeding from Gods graces, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly it muſt needs be divine.</p>

becauſe this is moſt agreeable to Pauls narration in recounting all his actions with the Apoſtles; wherein hee ſeemes to follow the order and courſe of time according whereto they fell out for after the diſſolution of the Councell at Jeruſalem, Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas immediately returned with Decrees unto Antioch, where for a time they continued teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, Act. 15.35. During this their continuance at Antioch, very probable it ſeemes that Peter might come thither, and then might bee the time of the action related heere betweene him and Paul; becauſe Barnabas who was alſo carried away with the diſſimulation of Peter and other Jewes, was then with Paul at Antioch; after which time wee never finde them together; for upon their next departure from Antioch, which was not long after they finally departed one from another, by reaſon of their diſſenting about John their Miniſter, as hath beene formerly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

                        <hi>FOR before that certaine came from James.</hi>] Theſe were by their birth Jewes, who had been bred up in the Jewiſh Religion: but by their faith they were Chriſtians: but as it ſeemes, ſo lately converted, that they were yet but weake in the faith, and therefore continued obſervers of the Jewiſh cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Theſe men came to Antioch from Jeruſalem while Peter was at Antioch: but whether they came thither as Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſent from James, or as voluntaries of their owne accord, either as ſpies or for other buſineſſe, it appeares not from Scripture: Yet from James they are ſaid to come, either autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively, becauſe they might have ſome direction or addreſſe from him: or locally, becauſe they came from the Church at Jeruſalem, where James was the Preſident or chiefe Paſtor.</p>

after their maner, and of their meates, altogether as they did eate, who obſerved not the differences of meats, nor other legall ceremonies. This action of Peter was very commendable; for although the Jewes by their Law eſteemed it unlawful to eate of ſome meates, ſuppoſing themſelves thereby polluted, becauſe they were forbidden by the Law of Moſes: yet unto the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of all ſorts, to whom the Law was now expired, it was by the Goſpel fully allowable to eate of any meate: and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly unto Peter it was moſt warrantable, by reaſon of his viſion of the great ſheet, wherein were all maner of meates, as Beaſts, creeping things, and Fowles, which God had cleanſed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to kill and eate.

This action in Peter was the thing that was blameable, and for which hee was by Paul reproved; for by this fact, Peter might and did very much blemiſh the truth and ſincerity of the Goſpel, by endangering the liberty therof; whileſt by his ouermuch indulgence to the Jewes who were the minor part, he ſeemed to betray the liberty of the Goſpel, and to give occaſion of ſcruple to the Chriſtian Gentiles who were far the major part, and far more conſiderable.</p>

And he feared them to incurre their diſpleaſure, or to give them offence by alienating their mindes both from himſelfe, and from the Doctrine of the Goſpel; for they might cenſure him as a tranſgreſſor, &amp; a deſertor of the Law, which cenſure would much blemiſh Peters authority, wherein the Church was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. This purpoſe of Peter to comply with the Chriſtian Jewes, was not in it ſelfe ſinfull, but only ſomwhat improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: becauſe thereby he too much neglected the edifying and confirming of thoſe Chriſtian Gentiles with whom he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}who yet co&cmbAbbrStroke;&EOLhyphen;ceived the&cmbAbbrStroke;&EOLhyphen;&s;elves bound to the Law.{/NOTE --> who were much the major and more conſiderable part, whereof ſomwhat more afterward. Hence it appears, that by the Decrees paſſed in the Synod at Jeruſalem, the Chriſtian
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62812:61"/>
Jewes did not yet underſtand or conceive themſelves diſobliged from the legall Ceremonies; but onely that the Gentiles on whom the Law of Moſes was never impoſed, were by thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees excuſed from thoſe Ceremonies; (though all believed not this neither;) for in that Synod the debate was onely concerning the Gentiles and not the Jewes; as it plainely appeares, Act. 15.10.11. Although Peter arguing in the Synod that the yoke of the Law was not to bee layd upon the Gentiles, doth produce ſuch Arguments, as make no more for the Gentile then the Jew, or prove the Jew no leſſe looſe from the Law then the Gentile; and the truth it ſelfe declares, that unto both people was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame way to ſalvation by Chriſt. Neither was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Gentile in this reſpect, to bee better then that of the Jew, to whom the Grace of Chriſt was by the promiſe of God peculiarly engaged; but the condition of the Gentile had beene better, if unto the Jew the obſervance of the legall Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies had been neceſſary to ſalvation, and not unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. But (as wee ſayd) the Chriſtian Jewes conceived not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to bee yet freed from thoſe Ceremonies, as may eaſily bee gathered from the ſpeech of James to Paul. Act. 21.20.21.24.25. Peter therefore being a Jew by Nation ſhould have offended thoſe Chriſtian Jewes who came from Jeruſalem to Antioch, if they had perceived him either converſant among the Gentiles, or negligent of the Jewiſh Ceremonies.</p>

And beſides, it was a thing moſt reaſonable, that Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles ſhould at laſt deale more freely and openly with the Jewiſh Chriſtians, in leading them on by degrees to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and truth of the Goſpel in this particular; eſpecially ſeeing formerly the Jewiſh Chriſtians of Jeruſalem, where the offence was moſt to be feared, were ſufficiently inſtructed by Peter and James,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}(Legall Ce&EOLhyphen;remonies why abro&EOLhyphen;gated.){/NOTE --> that the Legall Ceremonies were not neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it was Gods good pleaſure that upon his new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Ceremonies of the old ſhould ceaſe, to the end that all Nations both Jewes and Gentiles ſhould bee confederated under one Covenant, and be incorporated into one body, whereof Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be the Head; which could never be done, ſo long as thoſe Ceremonies were of force; for while they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, men could hardly, or not at all, conceive how that old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant could bee antiquated and expired. Beſides, whereſoever there remaine moſt Ceremonies, there is commonly more ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, then true and ſound Religion: becauſe betweene Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Verity there is a kind of antipathy. This point not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly underſtood, the benefit conferred upon us by Chriſt, and the way of the new Covenant in juſtifying us by faith, can never bee rightly conceived, as may eaſily bee collected from this Epiſtle. Wherefore it concerned the reſt of the Apoſtles

to afford their aſſiſtance unto Paul, who chiefly laboured in this, that at the leaſt the Jewiſh Chriſtians might not ſubduce and ſeparate themſelves from converſing and accompanying with their brethren of the Gentiles; eſpecially ſeeing Peter had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready practiſed it before, and might have continued alwayes to practiſe it; for to him from Heaven this point was in ſpeciall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner revealed; and what grounds ſoever they were which induced Peter to eat with Cornelius and his family, the ſame were ſtill in force to continue his converſation with the Antiochian Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who had in like maner received the Holy Ghoſt.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}cen&s;ured{/NOTE --> Peter therefore ſhould have perſiſted in converſing with his brethren of the Gentiles, whatſoever exceptions the Jewiſh Chriſtians ſhould take againſt it: or at leaſt ſhould have firſt notified his intention to the Gentile-Chriſtians, that he deſired to condiſcend a little to the Jewiſh infirmity; that the Gentiles might not bee troubled, if for a time he abſtayned from their company; that he did it not, becauſe hee beleft thoſe Ceremonies neceſſary to ſalvation, but only becauſe his brethren of the Jewes were ſo perſwaded.

The Judaizer judged and condemned the Gentilizer for a prophane and wicked ſinner; and the Gentilizer deſpiſed and ſcorned the Judaizer for a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and weake idiot.

But in reſpect of the ſincere Chriſtian, both were the Tares or the children of the wicked one, which Sathan the Enemy of Chriſt ſowed among the Wheat in the field of Chriſt. For as a right faith and a holy life is the ſeede and Wheate of Chriſt: So Errours and Vices in not walking uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel, how oppoſite or contrary ſo ever they bee one to another, are the ſeed and tares of Sathan, which hee ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to annoy the Wheate of Chriſt. For Tares, or rather, Juray or Darnell, are a vitious graine of a deſtructive nature, annoying, cumbring, hindring, and pulling downe, not onely one another, but any other Corne among which they grow, but eſpecially Wheate: So Judaiſme and Gentiliſme were Errours and Vices ſowed by Sathan, which annoyed, cumbred, and hindred not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one another, but alſo the truth and ſincerity of the Goſpel: Yet when the queſtion was moved for the extirpation or rooting out of the Tares,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Yet not to bee extirpa&EOLhyphen;ted.{/NOTE --> Chriſt denies it, and hee denies it for the Wheates ſake, Mat. 13.29. <hi>Leſt while yee gather up the Tares, yee roote up alſo the Wheate with them.</hi> For the Tares are rooted into the roote of the Wheate, both having one common root, one and the ſame Faith, one and the ſame Head, Chriſt Jeſus. And the Tares themſelves of both ſides deny it for their owne ſakes one againſt another: Yet both parties deny it not at

one and the ſame time; but each party denies it then, when hee is depreſt and feares to bee extirpated. And againe, both parties alſo affirme it one againſt another; yet both affirme it not in one and the ſame place: But each party affirmes it there where hee prevailes, and hopes to extirpate the other. By ſuch turnings and windings of Doctrine the myſtery of iniquity worketh; affirming and denying the ſame thing at ſeverall times, and vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their tenets as their advantages vary; profeſſing in words the Rule of Equity, in <hi>Doing to others whatſoever they would that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould doe unto them:</hi> But denying it in workes and doing the quite contrary. For they finde by experience, that the common capacities upon whom they worke, have not judgement enough to diſcover the myſtery of this iniquity; but are rather <hi>children, toſſed too and fro, and carried about with every winde of Doctrine, by the ſleight of men and cunning craftineſſe, whereby they lye in waite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> Epheſ. 4.14.</p>

                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Examples of this cariage,{/NOTE -->For according unto theſe rules the Apoſtles carried themſelves towards theſe two oppoſite parties, accommodating and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves ſometime to the one, and ſometime to the other, as the opportunities of perſons, times, and places required; <hi>In patience and meekeneſſe inſtructing thoſe that oppoſed themſelves;</hi> one while with great authority rebuking and reproving them; and another time with ſutable gravity comforting, and commending them. Alwayes moderating and tempering their ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and writings with ſuch wiſedome and diſcretion, that neither of theſe partyes might be loſt from the Goſpel, but both retained in the profeſſion of it, and both reduced to the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it, and others who had not yet received it, might be gained to the reception of it. Heare how Paul relateth his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and cariage toward both of them, 1 Cor. 9.19. <hi>Though I be free from all men, yet have I made my ſelfe ſervant unto all, that I might gaine the more; unto the Jewes I became as a Jew, that I might gaine the Jewes: to them that are under the Law as under the Law, that I might gaine them that are under the Law: to them that are without Law, as without Law (being not without Law to God, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law to Chriſt) that I might gaine them that are without Law: to the weake, became I as weake, that I might gaine the weake; I am made all things to all men, that I might by all meanes ſave ſome; and this I doe for the Goſpels ſake. &amp;c.</hi> And when he forbids all ſcandall or giving offence either to the Jewes or to the Gentiles, he produceth an example from himſelfe (1 Cor. 10.33.) even as I pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking mine owne profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and in what ca&s;es it aba&EOLhyphen;teth.{/NOTE -->And under theſe Applications the Apoſtles exerciſed their Chriſtian liberty, to Circumciſe or not Circumciſe, to eate or not eate with this or that party, as occaſion ſerved, and as farre as they might preſerve that liberty without ſcandall or giving offence. Yet when they fell upon a neceſſity of giving offence to one party, then they offended that way where the offence would be leaſt, conſidering all circumſtances; and this required ſuch circumſpection that ſometime a good man might miſtake. For herein was the miſtake of Peter at Antioch, for which Paul
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62812:68"/>
withſtood him to the face, and for which he was too blame; for before that certaine Jewes came from James, he did eate with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and ſeparated himſelfe from the Gentiles, fearing to give offence to the Jewes; not conſidering that thereby he gave a greater offence to the Gentiles, as the caſe then ſtood at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, where the Gentiles were the greater number and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Chriſtians; and therefore in that place the more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and the leſſe to be offended. The like miſtake was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the other Jewes there, who being ſincere Chriſtians for their Religion, diſſembled with Peter; and in Barnabas alſo who was carryed away with their diſſimulation. To be a ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian no way leavened either with Judaiſme or Gentiliſme; and to walke without ſcandall, not giving offence to either of theſe Sects; and when there is a neceſſity of offence, then to give that which is leaſt; theſe are three degrees of difficulty, whereof the laſt is the higheſt.</p>

And therefore their Judaizing in walking and living as did the Jewes. <hi>i. e.</hi> as themſelves had lived formerly, deſerved for a while ſome toleration, connivence and ſufferance: becauſe they lived ſo out of infirmity or weakneſſe, and in conſcience of that Religion, wherein they were borne and bred.

For hee that doth not right according to the Rules of Law and Juſtice, hee is unrighteous, and a perſon unrighteous is a ſinner. And the fact which doth conſtitute or make a man thus a legall ſinner to bee a tranſgreſſor, is ſome unlawfull act of his done by him againſt the Law.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}whereof ex&EOLhyphen;amples.{/NOTE --> Such ſinners were our firſt Parents, who by tranſgreſſing againſt the Law of Paradiſe, were of mankinde the firſt ſinners by whom ſinne entered into the world. Such a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was David, who in the caſe of Uriah tranſgreſſed the Laws againſt murder and adultety. Such a Sinner was Jeroboam who made Iſrael to ſinne; and ſuch was all Iſrael who did ſinne by tranſgreſſing the Law againſt worſhipping of Images. Such a Sinner was the woman, Luk. 7.37. <hi>Who waſhed the feete of Chriſt with her teares, and wiped them with the haire of her head, and kiſſed them and anointed them with oyntment;</hi> For ſhee was an Adultereſſe.

                     <p n="2"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}2. Morally, for the im&EOLhyphen;probous.{/NOTE -->2. It ſignifies Morally, <hi>quoad mores,</hi> for one who is Improbous, in not doing that right which hee might, ſhould, and ought to doe by the Rules of Morality, Equity, Decency, Charity, and Mercy. For hee that doth not right according to the Rules of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62812:72"/>
Equity, Decency, and Mercy, hee is unrighteous, and the perſon unrighteous is a Sinner. And the fact which doth conſtitute or make a man to become a ſinner morally or improbous, is not an act of his, that is unlawfull in reſpect of any Law; for the act may bee lawfull, and yet ſinfull enough to denominate him a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: But it is an act that is not honeſt and faire in reſpect of Equity and Decency. Such a Sinner was Cham, Gen. 9.22.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Whereof Examples in the Old Te&EOLhyphen;&s;tament,{/NOTE --> <hi>Who ſeeing his Fathers nakedneſſe, told his two brethren without:</hi> This act of his was a ſinne, for it was puniſhed with a heavy curſe of perpetuall ſlavery: Yet this was not a ſinne legally againſt any Law or Statute then being in force, which forbad that act; but it was a ſinne morally, againſt the Rule of good Manners, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Charity, for a ſonne to bee ſo improbous, unnaturall, and unkinde, as to blab of his fathers fault, which hee ſhould have concealed. Such Sinners were they, 1. Sam. 10.27. <hi>Who despiſed Saul, and brought him no Preſents.</hi> This act of theirs was a ſinne; for at the beginning of the verſe., the offenders are called the children of Belial: Yet this was no ſinne legally, nor an act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull againſt any Law of Moſes; but a morall ſinne of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probity, againſt the Rule of Morality, Equity, and Decency, for Subjects to deſpiſe their King, and upon his Election to bring him no Preſents. Such a Sinner was Nabal, 1. Sam. 25.10. <hi>Who ſayd, who is David, and who is the ſonne of Jeſſe? There bee many ſervants now a dayes that breake away every man from his Maſter; Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my fleſh that I have killed for my Shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they bee?</hi> This ſaying was a ſinne; for (verſ. 14.) one of Nabals owne ſervants cenſureth it for railing; and afterward (verſ. 17.) hee cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Maſter in theſe words; <hi>Hee is ſuch a man of Belial, that a man cannot ſpeake to him.</hi> Yet this ſinne of Nabal, was no legall ſinne againſt any Law of Moſes: But a morall ſinne of improbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, againſt equity and good manners; that a man of a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſhould bee ſo unmanerly, unthankefull, and unkinde, as to deny a little proviſion to David and his followers, who unto him had been ſo good, as to be a defence to him and his goods.</p>
                     <p>Come we down ſomewhat lower to an example or two of this improbity from the New Teſtament.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and in the New.{/NOTE --> Such an improbous Sinner was the wicked ſervant (Mat. 18.28.) who when his Lord had forgiven him a debt of ten thouſand talents, would neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give nor forbeare his fellow-ſervant, who owed him onely an hundred pence: but arreſted and impriſoned him for it. This act was a ſinne; for his Lord thereupon was ſo wrath, that revoking his former pardon of the debt, <hi>hee delivered him
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62812:73"/>
to the tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him.</hi> Yet this was no legall ſinne againſt any Law: becauſe the act in it ſelfe was very lawfull; for the Law allowes every Creditor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and ſue for his debt: but it was a morall ſinne againſt morality, equity, and Charity, for him to whom his Lord had forgiven a debt of ten thouſand talents, to exact from his fellow-ſervant a matter of an hundred pence. Such a Sinner was Dives, (Luke 16.19.) <hi>who was cloathed in purple, and fared ſumptuouſly every day; letting Lazarus lye at his gate full of ſores, and deſiring to be fed with the crummes that fell from the table.</hi> This prodigality upon himſelfe, and parcimony toward the poore, was a ſinne not legall, but morall, againſt the rules of equity, Charity, and mercy. Such Sinners were the Prieſt and the Levite, (Luke 10.31.) who ſeeing a man lye in the way, <hi>ſtripped, wounded, and halfe dead, paſſed by on the other ſide.</hi> This paſſage of theirs was no legall ſinne againſt any Law, but a morall ſinne againſt the rules of equity, humanity, courteſie, charity, and mercy. Laſtly, ſuch ſinners will the damned be found at the laſt day, when the finall Inditement ſhall runne againſt them in this form, (Mat. 25.42.) <hi>I was an hungred and ye gave me no meate; I was thirſty and ye gave me no drinke; I was a ſtranger and ye tooke me not in; naked and ye cloathed me not, ſick and in priſon and ye viſited mee not.</hi> Certainely theſe negligences are ſinnes; for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are curſed and puniſhed with this finall Judgement to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation: <hi>Depart from mee ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Divel and his angels.</hi> Yet they are not ſinnes legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Law of Moſes: but morally againſt the rules of equity, charity, and mercy.</p>

Yet unto the Calamitous the miſery which he ſuffers is not a puniſhment, but onely an affliction: becauſe no man is to be puniſhed for having no right, or for quitting his right, much leſſe for loſing it, if the loſſe be none of his fault, but againſt his will. Now according to the common rule and practice of denominations, he that hath no right, or not his due right, but miſſeth and faileth of his right, may be called unrighteous; and

Jurall juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from words of foure ſorts. 1. Of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,   2.

Juſtifying put for Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.   Juſtifying is a Court-word,   and a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery word,   and a word Teſtamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the ſenſe of it.   Man is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner jurally.   legally and morally.   God is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous jurally   and Morally   his kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to Man,   and their conveyance by Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,   which is a will <hi>ad pias cauſas.</hi>   in moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple maner.   The Nature of Juſtifying   exemplified in Abraham,   in Rahab,   in the Jews,   and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.   The Names of it, as,   adopting,   infranchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,   reconciling,   ingrafting,   ingratiating,   infeoffing,   ſeating,   allying,   inabling,   tranſlating,   forgiving,   redeeming.   The matter of it is a Right of ſtate,   two ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtates,   one of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.   another of freedome,   which is the ſtate of grace.   The ſtate whereto we are juſtified,   or rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.   The ſtate from which we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.   Juſtification makes in us a change on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jurall.   The Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to that ſtate,   exemplified in the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks.   The degree of our right to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,   exemplified in the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,   in David,   in a Legata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.   The Manner of Juſtifying is factive,   exemplified in Moſes,   Uriah,   and Arau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,   And that fact is teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary.   A recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:62812:78"/>1. The word <hi>Juſt or righteous,</hi> is taken legally <hi>quoad leges;</hi>
                        <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}1.

And all men ought to bee le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally righteous, eſpecially Judges and Rulers, whoſe uprightnes in other mens cauſes muſt be exactly legall; for the Law is the Rule whereby they muſt give Sentence and execute Judgement, declining neyther to the right hand, nor to the left, whether it concerne the good or the evill of the party whoſe cauſe is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for that which no way declines to neyther hand, is properly ſayd to be upright.

                     <p n="2"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}2. Morally; for the kind man,{/NOTE -->2. The word Righteous ſignifies morally, <hi>quoad mores;</hi> for one who is kinde and courteous, liberall, and bounteous, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acts of benefit and mercy; who is not onely ruled by the Law to give every man his due by Law, but in many caſes is over-ruled by his love, to give men more then their due, more good and leſſe evill, then by the Law is due unto them; whoſe maner is to conferre and convey rights unto men, by beſtowing benefits and doing kindneſſes, by giving favours and forgiving treſpaſſes. For he who out of his love, beſtows ſome benefit, favor, or kindeneſſe upon me, doth thereby create in me a right, intereſt, or claime unto the thing beſtowed; and conſequently is thence rightly denominated a righteous man; for if he be a righteous man, who is upright and deales with me according to that right or claime which by Law I had before: much more is he righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and properly ſo called, who by conferring ſome benefit or gift upon me, doth create ſome right or claime which before by Law I had not; and he that forgives my treſpaſſe, doth againſt the right of the Law give me a right of Releaſe from that penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he by the Law might have exacted from me. Now as all men ought to be legally righteous. <hi>i. e.</hi> upright according to the Law: ſo ought all men to be morally righteous, <hi>i. e.</hi> kind and curteous according to good maners; for no man upon earth is ſo indigent or poore, as not to bee able ſome way or other to doe a kindeneſſe, as at leaſt to forgive a treſpaſſe: Yet eminently this vertue is required from perſons of ability, and principally from Princes, whoſe Power and Offices lead them to give and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give in many caſes, partly beyond the Law, and partly againſt it.</p>

For of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal we may ſay that he was legally righteous or upright, to give every man his due: but that he was morally righteous or kinde to beſtow a courteſie, we cannot ſay; for he is branded to be ſuch a man of Belial, ſo unkind and churliſh that a man could not ſpeake to him; and he reviled David inſtead of relieving him, 1 Sam. 25.17. Of himſelfe Paul ſaith, that for legall righteouſnes or uprightnes which was by the Law, he was blameles.

and kindnes being the two maine degrees of righteouſnes, he that hath onely the firſt degree in being onely upright, he is imperfect; he therefore that hath both degrees in being both upright and kinde, he in the phraſe of the Scripture is called perfect; for though in each degree ſingly he may be, and is very imperfect, or peccant, yet for having both and joyning both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether he is accounted perfect.

For whoſoever in a Teſtament is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted as an Heire or a Legatary, that perſon is Juſtified, or made to have a right to that Inheritance or Legacy, which is therein conveyed or deviſed unto him.

Unto God therefore doe belong, not onely the things that may bee no mans, and the things that may bee any mans, but alſo the very things that are each mans, as the Lands, Goods, and Chattells which each man poſſeſſeth. For although God hath given the Earth to the Children of men, and ſome men in reſpect of others are great Lords and rich Owners: Yet all men even the greateſt Kings, in reſpect of God are but meane Lords, and petty Owners, or rather Tenants at will, who have but a precarious uſe of earthly things, the ſupreme ſeigniory and property whereof doth reſt in God, who ſtill retaines to himſelfe an abſolute and full power to diſpoſe of all things at his pleaſure, by giving and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them away at his will.

Hence the Scripture is very ſerious and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſetting forth Gods kindeneſſe; for ſhe magnifies it with the Attributes of <hi>great</hi> kindeneſſe, Joel. 2.13. and Jonah. 4.2. of <hi>loving</hi> kindeneſſe, Eſay. 63.7. and Jer. 31.3. and Hoſ. 2.19. and in the Pſalmes above 20. places; of <hi>mercifull</hi> kindeneſſe, Pſalm. 117.2. and Pſalm. 119.76. of <hi>marvellous</hi> kindeneſſe, Pſalm. 17.7. and Pſalm. 31.21. and of <hi>everlaſting</hi> kindeneſſe, Eſay. 54.8.

                     <p>And the kindneſſes which God beſtowes upon man (for the acts of kinde perſons are alſo called kindneſſes) are divine bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings beſeeming the goodnes and greatnes of God,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}his kindne&s;&EOLhyphen;&s;es to Man,{/NOTE --> as a right of heavenly freedome, a right of Alliance with God, and a right of inheritance in his kingdome. For God is ſo free, that his will is, to make man free of heaven, by giving him a right of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine freedome, as a Denizen, or Citizen of the Kingdome of Heaven. See John 8.32, 36. and Rom. 6.22. and Rom. 8.2. and 1 Cor. 7.22. and Epheſ. 2.19. and Heb. 8.10. And God is ſo kinde, as to make man his Kinſman, by giving him a right of divine alliance, in making him his Son, and becomming a father to him, which makes not a remote and diſtant alliance, but the neareſt and beſt degree of kindred. See John 1.12. and Rom. 8.14. and 2 Cor. 6.18. and Phil. 2.15. and Gal. 4.5. and 1 John 3.1, 2. So fatherly kinde, as to make man his heire, by giving him a right of inheritance in Heaven, where God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for him many Manors and Manſions, ſo goodly and ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the Manors and Manſions on earth are but the figures and ſhadowes of thoſe in Heaven; for God who hath feared man here upon earth will hereafter moſt gloriouſly ſettle him in Heaven, whereof he hath already made him the Heire, by giving him a preſent right to the future poſſeſſion of it; for this kinde of right makes the nature of an Heire. See Mat. 5.3. and Mat. 25.34. and John 14.2. and Rom. 8.17. and Gal. 4.7. and Epheſ. 1.3. and Epheſ. 2.6. and Tit. 3.7. and James <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But for the better conveyance and ſettling of theſe Heavenly kindneſſes, God frames his Will into a Teſtament,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and their conveyance by Te&s;ta&EOLhyphen;ment,{/NOTE --> wherein more bleſſings are deviſed and bequeathed unto man by way of gifts and Legacyes; for hence the holy Scriptures both New and Old,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62812:89"/>
are called Gods Teſtaments; though at the firſt making neither of them were written, but were nuncupative: becauſe God at firſt declared his will by the word of his mouth; for hence the ſame Teſtaments are called the word of God; but his Will being afterwards written, became the Scriptures. And God by publiſhing of his Teſtament, reveales the Gifts and Legacies thereof into promiſes; (for Gods promiſes are but his Gifts and Legacyes declared) he covenants with man for the performance of thoſe Promiſes; and confirmes his Covenant, that it may be irrevocable. Now the proper virtue and effect of Teſtaments, Promiſes, and Covenants, eſpecially being once confirmed, is to conſtitute, ordaine, impute, and convey unto the perſons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, rights, intereſts, and claymes to the things therein ſpecified. And the rights and claymes conſtituted, ordained, and conveyed in Gods Teſtament, are no leſſe precious then the inheritances of Heaven, whereto man is inſtituted Heire; for although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men here on earth, ſome Lands and inheritances cannot be diſpoſed by Will and Teſtament: yet all the inheritances of Heaven are deviſeable by the Will and Teſtament of God. And Gods Teſtament argues Gods marvellous loving kindnes; for can a man poſſibly ſhew greater love and kindnes, then firſt to give away all his eſtate, and at laſt to confirme that gift, give up his life? all which is done in the making of a Will; becauſe a Will is a Deed which makes away all, and yet it ſelfe is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, at leaſt not made of force, untill the death of the maker.</p>

And therefore againe paſſively and effectually, all the free men of Gods kingdome, and all the ſonnes and heyres of God are juſtified: becauſe it is the nature of a freeman, of a ſon, and of an heyre, to have a preſent right to a future eſtate.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}exemplified in Abraham,{/NOTE --> When unto Abraham who at firſt was a ſinner and a ſtranger, God by his Will and Teſtament deviſed theſe earthly bleſſings; That he ſhould have an heyre from his owne body, and ſhould have the Kingdome of Canaan for his inheritance; Gods will was that Abraham ſhould have a preſent right to thoſe bleſſings, and when effectually Abraham had that right, then was he juſtified.

                        <p>The full meaning therefore of the Apoſtles Negative in this verſe, is this, <hi>A man is not juſtified by any workes whatſoever,</hi>
                           <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}No works ju&s;tifie Pro&EOLhyphen;creantly,{/NOTE --> no not by the ſpirituall workes of the Law. <hi>i. e.</hi> his Moralities, or morall workes by poorenes of ſpirit, meekenes, purenes of

heart, meeknes, mercifulnes, &amp;c. being meaſured by the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſenſe of Gods Law, are not cordiall, liberall, and perfect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make him a title whereby to acquire and have a true right of divine alliance with God, and of the heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance conſequent to that ſtate. This Negative the Apoſtle proves in this Chapter by three ſeverall arguments, which are not to be here anticipated, but ſhall be ſpecified in their due places; in all which he mentions workes with reſtraint of them to the Law, but his arguments hold againſt works in generall; and in his Epiſtle to the Romans he handles the very ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of workes in generall without any reſtraint of them to the Law, proving it there by the ſame arguments alleaged heere: yet becauſe there he produceth two arguments which here are omitted, I ſhall therefore mention thoſe two, and but onely mention them. One is Rom. 3.27. and the ſame is alſo allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, Epheſ. 2.9. If mans title or cauſe procreant whereby he acquireth, or hath a right of divine alliance and inheritance with God, come by his owne workes, then all boaſting on mans part cannot be excluded; for man doth naturally boaſt of his works, particularly of ſuch workes whereby he acquires ſome great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance and inheritance, eſpecially of ſuch as would make him a divine alliance to be the ſon and heire of God. The other is Rom. 4.4. If mans title &amp;c. be by his workes, then by the Law of equity, heavenly bleſſednes becomes a debt, and is due unto him as his wages, which he hath earned by his worke. Now theſe two reſpects, that man ſhould be able either to boaſt of his bleſſednes, or to earne it, are both derogatory to the love, grace, mercy, and kindnes of God; for where is Gods grace and his kindnes, when either I can boaſt of my earnings, or he is drawne to pay his debt?</p>

That <hi>the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall workes of the Law are no title whereby a man is juſtified procreantly or acquiſitively to the ſpirituall promiſes thereof.</hi> For if the ſpirituall workes which are farre more ſublime and more pleaſing to God, make man no title to the ſpirituall promiſes, as was proved before, much leſſe can the literall workes doe it, which are farre leſſe.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}nor to the earthly.{/NOTE --> 2. That <hi>the literall workes of the Law were no title whereby the Iſraelites were acquiſitively juſtified to the temporall promiſes thereof.</hi> For when God gave them the Land of Canaan to poſſeſſe it, hee utterly diſclaymes their workes and their uprightnes from being any title whereby they acquired their right of poſſeſſion; Deut. 9.5. <hi>Not for thy righteouſneſſe, or for the uprightneſſe of thy heart doeſt thou goe to poſſeſſe their Land: but for the wickedneſſe of theſe Nations

For mans Juſtification is commonly in Scripture referred disjunctively to one of theſe three titles, that it is either by Birth, or by Workes, or by Faith; and the Scripture doth cleerely diſclaime the two former titles by Birth and Workes, to inferre the latter by Faith. The title by Birth is diſclaimed, Rom. 9.6.7.8. <hi>For they are not all Iſrael which are of Iſrael, neither becauſe they are the ſeede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, are they all children; but in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeede bee called, i. e. They which are the children of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God; but the children of the Promiſe are counted for the ſeede.</hi> And the title by Workes is excluded, Rom. 3.19.20. <hi>Now wee know that what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law; that every mouth may bee ſtopped, and all the World may become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; therefore by the deedes of the Law, there ſhall no fleſh bee juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his ſight; for by the Law is the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to that right reaſoning which is framed in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, the concluſion muſt needes inferre the remaining title by faith; for ſo the Apoſtle concludes, Rom. 3.28. <hi>Therefore wee conclude that a man is juſtified by faith.</hi> As therefore there needes no definition to open the nature of Birth and Workes, becauſe thoſe things are ſufficiently knowne of themſelves, and therefore all Writers paſſe them over undefined: So there needes no definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to declare the nature of Faith. Becauſe Faith is either mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt enough of it ſelfe, or ſufficiently poynted out by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction

                        <p>Neither is there poſſibility,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Neither can it be defined,{/NOTE --> to give an intire and true definition of Faith; becauſe Faith is a thing ſo indefinite and ſo generall, that it hath no genus which will comprehend it; and it is a thing ſo notable &amp; ſo well known, that there are not other words more knowne, whereby to expreſſe and teach the nature of it. They therefore who define Faith to bee a Confidence in God, are pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant againſt the nature of a definition two wayes. 1. Becauſe Confidence is a word more obſcure then Faith, and therefore cannot teach the knowledge of it; for hee that knowes not what Faith is, will never bee made to know it, by telling him that it is a Confidence; becauſe the word Confidence is more unknowne unto him, and leaves him more to ſeeke, then the word Faith doth. 2. Becauſe Confidence is a word more narrow; for all Confidence is Faith, but all Faith is not Confidence; ſeeing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is but one kinde of Faith, or rather a degree of it; the like defect may bee found in the word Affiance. Other definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faith commonly exhibited by Divines, are either ſo wide that they will not juſtifie at all, or elſe ſo narrow that they will juſtifie onely under the Goſpel.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Yet it may be de&s;igned a wayes:{/NOTE --> Yet becauſe divine faith is an act ſo acceptable to God, and ſo deſirable to bee underſtood, I ſhall ſutably to our preſent purpoſe (declining all definitions and other ſignifications of the word which in divers learned Writers are ſufficiently layd out) propoſe two Notions, deſignes, or caſes thereof; one in generall as it magnifies God, the other more particular as it juſtifies man: Both which added together, may ſerve as ſignes and markes to breed a competent and comfortable knowledge thereof.</p>
                        <p n="1"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}1 An high e&s;teem of God is faith,{/NOTE -->1. The firſt notion is this: <hi>An high esteeme of Gods exiſtence, greatneſſe and goodneſſe, is Faith in God.</hi> For Believing is oppoſed to Diſpiſing; as therefore when wee have a baſe and low eſteem of the weakeneſſe and badneſſe of any perſon, wee are ſayd to deſpiſe him: So contrarily when wee have a rich and high eſteeme of that greatneſſe and goodneſſe which wee conceive in any perſon, then wee have faith in him; and when God is the perſon whom wee ſo eſteeme, then wee have faith in God. But although ſuch a faith bee acceptable and pleaſing unto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is agreeable to his will and to the truth, that hee ſhould bee eſteemed as hee is: Yet this kinde of faith is not Juſtifying to acquire any right unto the believer; becauſe it is generall and common to perſons juſtified, and to ſome not juſtified; in whom this faith is onely ſervile to breed in them feare and trembling.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62812:100"/>
Such a faith was in the people of Nineveh;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}exemplified in the Nine&EOLhyphen;vites,{/NOTE --> for at the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jonah, that within forty dayes Nineveh ſhould bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, <hi>the people</hi> (Jon. 3.5.) <hi>believed God, i. e.</hi> They had ſuch an high eſteeme of Gods greatneſſe and goodneſſe, of his power and juſtice therein included, that hee could and would execute the judgement threatned againſt them; and this faith bred in them a feare of God, and that feare bred a Faſt, whereby they declared their Repentance.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and the De&EOLhyphen;vils.{/NOTE --> And ſuch a faith is in the Divels, Jam. 2.19. <hi>The Divels alſo believe and tremble, i. e.</hi> They have an high eſteeme of the greatneſſe of Gods Power, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Juſtice, that hee can and will execute his vengeance upon them for their Rebellion; and this their faith is onely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, for it breeds in them feare, and makes them to tremble.</p>

The ſecond notion of faith is this: <hi>An acceptance of Gods promiſe, is Faith.</hi> The difference betweene Gods Promiſe and his Precept, will cleerely teach us the nature of faith and workes; and conſequently the true difference betweene them. The right to a thing and the poſſeſſion thereof are diſtinct reſpects that may bee transferred either joyntly, both at once, at the ſame time, as is done in a Donation; or they may bee transferred ſeverally one after another, by conveying the right at one time, and reſpiting the delivery of poſſeſſion till another, as is done in a Promiſe. Gods Promiſe therefore is his declared Will to impute unto thee a preſent right,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}(the Nature of Gods Pro&EOLunhyphen;mi&s;e{/NOTE --> to the future poſſeſſion of ſome bleſſing. For God in his Promiſe willeth unto thee two diſtinct things. 1. That thy right to the bleſſing ſhould bee in preſent. 2. That thy poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that bleſſing ſhould bee future. And then according heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, hee <hi>requires</hi> from thee two diſtinct acts of thy will in correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding and conſenting to his. 1. Thy Acceptance, or taking of the preſent right to the bleſſing. 2. An Expectance or truſting to the future poſſeſſion of it. I ſay, God <hi>requires</hi> thy acceptance; becauſe Gods promiſſory will is not compulſory to will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thy acceptance, by neceſſitating or binding thee thereto; for in ſo thinking, thou deſtroyeſt the nature of Gods promiſe, by turning it into a Precept, whereof the effect is compulſory and binding. But Gods promiſe is only Invitatory to will and require thy acceptance, by calling, moving, and drawing thee thereto, in uſing all the gratious and proper meanes conducing to that end: Yet leaving thee free at thine owne choice, either to accept or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it. A refuſall or Rejecting of Gods Promiſe is Unbeliefe; an Acceptance or taking of the preſent right to the bleſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, is Faith; and an Expectance or truſting to the future poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the bleſſing, is Hope; for Faith and Hope are the acts of mans will, anſwerable and agreeable to the will of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

Contrarily,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and of his Precept){/NOTE --> Gods Precept is his declared Will to impoſe upon thee a preſent bond to the future obſervance of ſome duty. And herein Gods Will is, that thy bond to this duty ſhould be preſent, and thy obſervance of the duty ſhould be future from thence forward. But Gods Preceptory Will is not Invitatory to will and require thy obſervance, or to leave thee free at thine owne choyſe either to obſerve or tranſgreſſe it; for in thinking ſo, thou deſtroyeſt Gods Precept, whoſe nature it is to will and command thy obſervance, by laying upon thee a neceſſity thereof; yet that neceſſity is not fatall, but legall. A tranſgreſſion of Gods Precept, is ſin; an obſervance thereof, is workes; and when the workes are cordiall and liberall, done heartily and freely with all the heart and all the ſoule, then the workes are Love. For workes and love are acts of mans will anſwerable to the will of Gods Precept; and therefore are different from faith and hope, which anſwer to the will of his promiſe: becauſe his promiſe and his Precept are Wills different and oppoſite.</p>
                        <p>This laſt notion of faith may be further illuſtrated from three grounds. 1. From the common definition of Faith,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and illu&s;tra&EOLhyphen;ted 3 wayes.{/NOTE --> That faith is an aſſent to every revealed word of God;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}1 From the common de&EOLhyphen;finition of it.{/NOTE --> which kind of faith is ſo large and wide, that it may aſwell condemn as juſtifie: yet it will ſerve to enlighten our notion. For Gods Precepts are his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed word: but theſe becauſe they proceed from his holines and uprightnes, are but hard words, and ſo hard, that when they were ſpoken from Mount Sinai, the Iſraelites could not indure to heare them, but entreated that they might heare no more of them. See Exod. 20.19. &amp; Deut. 18.16. &amp; Heb. 12.19, 20. And Gods Judgments are his revealed word: but theſe becauſe they come from his wrath and anger, are but ill words, and farre worſe then the former, for they are curſed and fearefull words; ſee the Curſes of them at large, Levit. 26. and Deut. 28. But Gods promiſe is his revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led word alſo; and this word becauſe it proceeds from his love and kindnes, is his good word; for ſo it is called, 1 Kings 8.56. <hi>There hath not failed one word of all his good promiſe;</hi> where for <hi>good promiſe</hi> the Hebrew hath <hi>good word;</hi> and Jerem. 29.10. <hi>I will vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit you, and performe my good word unto you. i. e.</hi> my promiſe for your returne from captivity. If therefore an Aſſent to the words of Gods precepts and judgements which are hard and ill words, be Faith, as indeed it is; though in effect it prove but a ſorrowfull and wofull faith, which can juſtifie no man, but may convict all of ſin, and condemne many to death; for it is that faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Divels believe and tremble: much more an Acceptance of Gods promiſe which is his good word, is faith; becauſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance is more then Aſſent, and more then Conſent; for it is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62812:101"/>
an act ſubſequent unto a Conſent, whereby a Conſent is ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ratified. As plainly appeares in moſt contracts, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that of Marriage; where after the mutuall Conſent of the parties to have each other, there followes a mutuall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance in taking each other. Hence it is manifeſt, that over and beſides all other ſorts of Faith, there are three ſorts anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the word of Gods Will; <hi>viz.</hi> a promiſſory, a precepto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a judicatory faith; (for ſo let us call them till we finde fitter appellations) becauſe the promiſes, precepts, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, are the words of his Will.</p>
                        <p n="2"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}2 From the Concurre&cmbAbbrStroke;ce of it to a Promi&s;e:{/NOTE -->2. From the Concurrence of faith to a promiſe. The acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a promiſe are chiefly three; namely, the Making, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, and the Performing of it; unto all which from the firſt to the laſt, faith muſt needs concurre in a manner as a Soule, wherewith the promiſe is animated and lives, and without which it expires and dyes, becomming fruſtrate and voyd. For the Making of a promiſe is a giving of faith; ſo the beſt Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts and Caſuiſts define a promiſe, though we for thy better underſtanding defined it otherwiſe. And the Performing of a Promiſe is a keeping of faith, which is commonly called Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for hence God is called faithfull: becauſe when he hath been gracious to give his faith by making a promiſe, he will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to keep his faith by performing it. And therefore the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a promiſe (which intercedeth between the making and performing) is a taking of faith; for when the thing given is faith, then the thing taken muſt needs be the ſame, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith alſo. And if the performance of a promiſe doth deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate him faithfull who makes it, as in all good Writers and in common ſpeech it doth: much more doth the Acceptance of the promiſe denominate him faithfull who takes it: becauſe the faith of the taker doth naturally precede the faithfullneſſe of the giver, as acceptance naturally precedes performance. But if Gods Promiſe have any effect at all, and be not fruſtrated by a refuſall, that effect in thee muſt needs bee faith; for ſeeing Gods Promiſe is a Declaration of his Will to deviſe unto thee a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent right to the future poſſeſſion of ſome bleſſing; this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comming from God, doth or ſhould worke in thee a ground to hope for that future bleſſing; and a ground of things hoped for, is faith, as the Apoſtle notifies it; Heb. 11.1. <hi>Now faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for. i. e.</hi> a ground for hope is faith. And becauſe the bleſſing is future, therefore it is not ſeene; for things future are not ſeen: yet Gods declaration of the futurity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth, or ſhould produce in thee an evidence or knowledge of it, and an evidence or knowledge of things not ſeen, is faith; as

the Apoſtle againe deſignes it in the former verſe.</p>

God promiſed unto Abraham a Sonne and Heire of his owne body, and a numerous Poſterity, as the Starres of Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> God declared unto Abraham his will to give him a preſent right to that future bleſſing; and in the verſe following, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham believed in the Lord, i. e.</hi> Hee accepted of Gods Promiſe in taking it; and this taking was ſeconded with truſting to it; for by his acceptance, hee had a good ground to hope for a ſonne, and an evidence for a ſonne not yet ſeene; which ground and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is faith or beliefe: But the act which cauſed that ground and evidence was his Acceptance or taking the Promiſe. God by the meſſage of Moſes promiſed unto the Iſraelites in Egypt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from their bondage, and an entrance into Canaan, <hi>and</hi> (Exod. 4.31.) <hi>the people believed, i. e.</hi> They accepted of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by taking it, and their taking cauſed their truſting to it, <hi>i. e.</hi> Their faith cauſed their hope of it; and to expreſſe their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe for it, <hi>They bowed their heads and worſhipped.</hi>

                           <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Faith is a Pa&s;&s;ive act,{/NOTE -->Hence it appeares that Faith is a paſſion; for although it bee an act of the will, yet it is not an act active, which conſiſteth in working or doing any thing; but an act paſſive or act of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in receiving and imbracing that ſtate or condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the love and kindeneſſe of God would put thee; or which is all one, in not refuſing or rejecting the good will and pleaſure of God towards thee. And therefore in Scripture Faith is expreſſed by theſe two paſſive words of Receiving and Imbracing;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}of Receive&EOLhyphen;ing,{/NOTE --> as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the word, Luk. 8.13. <hi>They on the Rock are they, which when they heare, receive the word with joy, i. e.</hi> Believe or accept the word of Gods promiſe; as it plainely appeares by the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following, wherein the Verbe <hi>receive</hi> is changed into <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, which for a while believe,</hi> and Receiving Chriſt, John 1.12. <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſonnes of God, even to them that believe on his name;</hi> where wee ſee in like maner that the former Verbe <hi>received,</hi> is interpreted by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſignifie <hi>believing;</hi>

And by theſe two paſſive words of Receiving and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, Faith is oppoſed to the two contrary words of Refuſing and Rejecting, which will not bee paſſive, and therefore ſignifie Unbeliefe; as Refuſing Chriſt, Heb. 12.25. <hi>See that yee refuſe not him that ſpeaketh, i. e.</hi> See that yee believe him; for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing is receiving, and receiving is believing; and Rejecting Chriſt, John. 12.48. <hi>Hee that rejecteth mee and receiveth not my words, i. e.</hi> Hee that believeth not in mee; for of the former words the latter are an Expoſition.

Thou ſeeſt heereby that in making faith, all the action lies on Gods part, in declaring his promiſe, and perſwading thy acceptance: Bee thou onely Gods Patient to ſuffer his action and operation upon thee, and the act of faith is done.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}in an ea&s;ie and noble maner:{/NOTE --> For the paſſion or ſufferance on thy part is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther painefull nor ſhamefull, but moſt eaſie, gentle, and noble; for it conſiſteth onely in accepting, receiving, or embracing his kindeneſſe towards thee, or at leaſt in not refuſing or rejecting it.

For a true and lively faith is ſomewhat like the affections of the minde, or like the diſeaſes of the body, both which are paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet have powerfull and violent operations.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}yet only ju&EOLhyphen;rally,{/NOTE --> Yet unto both theſe, faith is unlike heerein, that her effects flow not from her neceſſarily and naturally <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> according to the courſe of nature; but jurally and arbitrarily <hi>ex inſtituto Dei,</hi> according to the ordinance and appointment of God.

There is betweene faith and ſin this contrariety, that as Faith is the acceptance of Gods promiſe, ſo Sin is a repugnance to his precept; and therefore the effects of faith have a contrary reſemblance to the effects of ſin. Sin hath in it leſſe entity then to be a paſſion, becauſe every ſin is a privation, and moſt ſins are meere omiſſions: yet ſuch are the effects of ſin, that from thence follow all the ſtirres and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles on earth; as the privates miſeries of diſtreſſes, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, baniſhments, and fearfull executions, and the publicke ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of warre, famine, and peſtilence; for too manifeſt it is, that ſin hath ſtrength enough to produce all theſe effects, yet ſin hath not this ſtrength from her ſelfe, but from the Law, 1.

For manifeſt it is from Scripture, that faith hath ſtrength enough to produce all theſe effects: yet faith hath not this ſtrength from her ſelfe as ſhe is an act of man, but from the grace of God, who to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, is gratious and favourable unto faith, by honouring it in that high degree, as to attribute, aſſigne or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute unto it theſe ſtrong and mighty effects.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and they are chiefly 4.{/NOTE --> Whereof prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to our preſent purpoſe, I ſhall mention thoſe, which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <p n="1"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}1 It enters Gods Cove&EOLhyphen;nant of grace.{/NOTE -->1. The firſt effect of this promiſſory faith is, To enter Gods covenant of grace. For Gods promiſe before the acceſſe of thy faith to accept it, is in reſpect of thee but a ſponſion or ſingle act of his will on his part to deviſe unto thee a preſent right to the future poſſeſſion of his bleſſings. But by the acceſſe of faith on thy part to accept it, his promiſe is advanced and formed into a Covenant with thee in particular, whereinto thou entreſt by the act of thy faith. Becauſe thy faith is an act of thy will to accept and take that preſent right, which his will is to grant and give thee; and conſequently by meanes of thy faith thy will is agreeable to his will touching one and the ſame thing to be had: and agreement of wills betweene ſeverall parties for the having of one and the ſame thing, makes up the intire nature of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}that why &s;o called:{/NOTE --> and conſequently makes up thy entrance thereinto. And the covenant entred by meanes of this faith is the covenant of Grace; which is ſo called, becauſe the ground thereof is Gods grace, which moveth him to this act of kindneſſe, in making or paſſing his promiſe unto man: and becauſe the matter thereof is meerely gratious, conſiſting of thoſe favours, benefits, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings conferred upon man, which are not due to man by any Law. In the Old Teſtament Gen. 15. God covenants with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham by way of promiſe, that God on his part would bee unto Abraham a ſhield, and an exceeding great reward, that he would give him a ſon and heire of his owne body: and Abraham ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon enters covenant with God, that hee on his part did beleeve in the Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> did accept, receive, and embrace thoſe promiſes; heere was a Covenant of Grace, becauſe the ground of it was Gods grace, and the matter very gratious. In the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Heb. 8.10. God covenants with thee by way of promiſe, that hee on his part will put his Lawes into thy mind and write them in thy heart, that he will be a God unto thee, and take thee for one of his people, that he will teach thee to know him in reſpect of his greatnes, goodnes, and kindnes toward thee, that he will be mercifull to thy unrighteouſneſſe, not onely to forgive, but alſo to forget thy ſins and iniquities. If thou on thy part accept theſe promiſes by thy faith, thou thereby entreſt Gods Covenant, and the Covenant thou entreſt is the Covenant of Grace, becauſe the ground of it is Gods grace, and the matter of it very gracious.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and how it differs from that of works.{/NOTE --> Contrarily, the Covenant made with God by meanes of a Preceptory faith is the Covenant of workes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ground thereof is mans duty, as he is the worke or creature of God, owing all allegiance, obedience, and obſervance
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62812:103"/>
unto his Lord and Maker: and becauſe the matter thereof is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, conſiſting of thoſe workes, Offices, and ſervices, which by Gods Law are due from man to God. In the Old Teſtament (Gen. 17.1.10.) God covenants with Abraham by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, that Abraham on his part <hi>ſhould walke before the Lord and be perfect,</hi> upright, or ſincere, and <hi>that every male childe in Abrahams family ſhould be Circumciſed;</hi> here was a Covenant of workes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ground of it was Abrahams duty, and the matter ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what laborious for workes to be done. Againe in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament (Mat. 5.3.) God covenants with thee by way of Precept, that thou on thy part <hi>ſhalt be poore in ſpirit, ſhalt mourne, ſhalt bee meeke, ſhalt hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, ſhalt bee mercifull, ſhalt be pure in heart, ſhalt be a Peace-maker, ſhalt ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake.</hi> Heere againe is a Covenant of works, becauſe the ground of it is thy duty, and the matter ſomewhat labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In a word, every promiſe of God is a Covenant of grace, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Precept of God a Covenant of workes, every judgement of God a Covenant of Curſes, and every voluntary ſin of man is an involuntary Covenant to ſuffer thoſe curſes.</p>
                        <p n="2"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}2 It a&s;&s;ures Gods pro&EOLhyphen;mi&s;e,{/NOTE -->2. The ſecond effect is, to aſſure Gods promiſe. The promiſe of God, though in reſpect of his will on his part, it be firme, ſure, and faſt: yet in reſpect of any right or benefit thence accruing to thee, it is neither firme, ſure, nor fact, before thy faith or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of it: but by vertue of thy faith or acceptance it is made ſtable, firme, and ſure. Becauſe that promiſe which Gods will is, ſhould be ſtable, firme, and ſure, is by thy faith actually eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, affirmed, and aſſured; for, as was ſhewed before, thy faith doth advance and forme Gods promiſe into a Covenant; and a Covenant is an agreement ſo ſtable, firme, and ſure, that the parties agreed cannot repent, revoke, recede, or goe back. And if a Conſent of the parties to be married, doth make the mariage ſure, (for upon their conſent we uſe to ſay they are ſure together,) much more doth thy acceptance of Gods promiſe make thy alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to him ſtable, firme, and ſure. And this faith doth aſſure,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}for the po&s;&EOLhyphen;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it,{/NOTE --> not onely thy preſent alliance, but alſo the future poſſeſſion of all thoſe bleſſings which unto this alliance are appendent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, as the Regeneration or ſanctification of thy minde, the Remiſſion of thy ſins, the Reſurrection of thy body, and thy Life everlaſting. And unto this aſſurance, this faith is quickened and ſtrengthened by the firſt notion of faith, which is a high eſteeme of Gods goodnes and greatnes, that what the goodnes of his will was pleaſed to promiſe, that the greatnes of his power is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to performe. For this eſtimatory Faith by giving unto God the glory of his goodnes and greatnes, doth nouriſh and feed up
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62812:104"/>
thy promiſſory faith into an aſſurance of a ſtrong and full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Gods performance; though unto thy ſelfe thou ſeeme never ſo poore and dead a Creature.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}again&s;t all difficulties,{/NOTE --> For notwithſtanding all the difficulties, and caſualties in the world that may ſeeme to diſturb Gods performance; notwithſtanding thy ignorance in many poynts of Religion that may ſeeme to hinder it; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſinnes of errour and frailty that may ſeeme to croſſe it; notwithſtanding thy death and diſſolution in the grave that may ſeeme to bury it: Yet after all theſe, God remaines conſtant, firm and ſure, both willing and able to performe his promiſe, and will actually performe it unto thee.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}exemplified in Abraham.{/NOTE --> And of this aſſurance thou haſt a precedent in Abrahams faith, which notwithſtanding the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his owne body, and of Sarahs Wombe, was ſo firme, ſure, and ſtrong, that hee was ſure of a ſonne, becauſe he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not the deadneſſe of his body, but the goodneſſe of Gods will, and the greatneſſe of his power, Rom. 4.19. <hi>And being not weake in faith, hee conſidered not his owne body now dead, when hee was about</hi> 100. <hi>yeare old, neither yet the deadneſſe of Sarahs wombe; hee ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbeliefe, but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully perſwaded, that what hee had promiſed,</hi>
                           <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Amen, what it &s;ignifies.{/NOTE --> 
                           <hi>hee was able alſo to peforme.</hi> Hence Amen the Hebrew word for faith doth alſo ſignifie verity, conſtancy, firmeneſſe, and ſureneſſe: Becauſe it is the nature of faith to bee true, conſtant, firme, and ſure; not onely formally for the quality of it, as it is oppoſed to falſhood, doubting, ſtaggering, and wavering; but alſo effectively for the virtue of it, becauſe it makes the promiſes of God to bee ſtable, conſtant, true, firme, and ſure; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and without it, will prove fruſtrate and voyd, to bee of no force or effect to him who diffides them. And this Aſſurance of Gods promiſe is an effect ſo peculiar to thy faith, that not workes but faith is ordained for thy title, to this very end and purpoſe, that the promiſe might bee ſure unto thee, Rom. 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might bee by grace, to the end the promiſe might bee ſure to all the ſeed.</hi>

The third effect is, to oblige both parties. God at the firſt was not obliged to make any promiſe, but was altogether free, either to make or forbeare it; and having made it, hee is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to performe it, untill it bee accepted; for a promiſe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, is not at all obligatory; or when it is accepted by ſome, hee is not obliged to performe it to others, till they have accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it for themſelves: But when his promiſe is accepted by faith, there reſults from thence a double or mutuall obligation upon both parties, whereby each is bound to the other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither can recede or goe back; whereby each becomes deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62812:104"/>
to the other, and therefore alſo each is creditor to the other. Becauſe as was ſhewed before, by faith thou entreſt the Covenant of Gods grace, and that Covenant is a contract of alliance, wherein God is allyed unto thee as a Father, and thou unto him as a Sonne and Heire; and contracts breed not a ſingle obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon one of the parties onely, but a double and mutuall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon both parties, whereby each is reciprocally bound to the other. As wee ſee in the contract of Marriage, which is the ground of all naturall and legitimate alliance by blood, the man is thereby bound to performe unto his Wife all the offices and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Husband, and reciprocally the woman is bound to all the offices and duties of a Wife; for hence Marriage is called Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, becauſe it lockes and bindes the parties wedded. And all Alliances are alſo Contracts; becauſe an alliance is <hi>alligatio par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, i. e.</hi> a binding or tying of parties together each to other.</p>
                        <p>One obligation reſulting from thy faith is upon God,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}1. God, who bindes him&EOLhyphen;&s;elfe by his Pro&EOLhyphen;mi&s;e,{/NOTE --> who therein becomes thy gratious debtor, to owe thee all the bleſſings, which hee was pleaſed to promiſe; and thereupon doth oblige and binde himſelfe to the performance; particularly to perform unto thee, all the offices of a kinde, loving and gratious Father, according to thy divine alliance with him, which is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and leading promiſe. Becauſe (as wee ſhewed before) an effect of thy faith is to aſſure Gods promiſe by making it firm and ſure; which certainely is then made firme and ſure, when God is obliged to performe it, and enters bond for thy ſecurity. And God the more abundantly to corroborate this bond of his promiſe, doth binde it over againe with the bond of his Oath,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and by his Oath.{/NOTE --> that by two immutable and irrevocable things thou mighteſt have a ſtrong aſſurance. For thus God bound himſelfe to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, by making a promiſe to him, and by ſwearing the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, and becauſe hee could ſweare by none greater, hee ſware by himſelfe, <hi>and ſayd</hi> (Gen. 22.16.) <hi>By my ſelfe have I ſworn, ſaith the Lord, for becauſe thou haſt done this thing, &amp;c, that in bleſſing I will bleſſe thee.</hi> And after the ſpace of 400. yeares, God acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged this bond, for when hee gave the Iſraelites poſſeſſion in the Land of Canaan, hee therefore did it, that hee might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his Promiſe and his Oath made unto their Fathers, Deut. 9.5. <hi>The Lord thy God doth drive theſe Nations out from before thee, that hee may performe the word which the Lord ſware unto thy Fathers, Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob.</hi> For if by the Rule of Piety all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are bound to performe their Promiſes and Oaths, which they ſware in the name of God: Much more is the moſt holy God obliged to performe his Promiſe and Oath, which hee ſweares by himſelfe in his owne name. See heere the force and power of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62812:105"/>

For as in the former clauſe, workes were reſtrayned to the Law, ſo heere faith is limited unto Chriſt, and conſequently the faith of Chriſt whereby a man is juſtified, is oppoſed to the workes of the Law, whereby a man is not juſtified. For that faith whereby a man hath a preſent right to the benefits and bleſſings of the New Teſtament muſt be the faith <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt, i. e. in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt is not the ſubject of this faith heere, who doth beleeve: but the object of it, in whom wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. A like phraſe of ſpeech we have, Marc. 11.22. where the Tranſlation is faith in <hi>God,</hi> but the Originall is faith <hi>of God,</hi> as is noted in the margin. So againe, Act. 3.16. the Originall is, through faith <hi>of his name:</hi> but the Tranſlation rightly expreſſeth it <hi>in his name.</hi> For faith in reference unto Chriſt, is in the New Teſtament varied by theſe fowr particles, <hi>of, in, through and toward
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62812:106"/>
Chriſt;</hi> which although ſometime they may ſeeme to argue diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpects, yet generally they ſignifie the ſame faith referred in the ſame reſpect unto the ſame perſon.</p>
                        <p>If an high eſteeme of Gods exiſtence, goodneſſe,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}what it is.{/NOTE --> and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, be faith in God, then an high eſteeme of Jeſus for his exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, goodneſſe, and greatneſſe, that he is the Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> that divine and ſacred perſon who is God, the ſon of God, anointed for the mediatour of the New Teſtament, is faith in Jeſus Chriſt. And if an acceptance of Gods promiſes, be faith in God, then an acceptance of them by the meanes or from the hand of Jeſus Chriſt, is faith in Jeſus Chriſt. A juſtifying faith under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is not made up by any one of theſe degrees ſingle or alone, but muſt be completed and exalted to both theſe degrees; for both theſe notions muſt concurre to perfect the faith of Jeſus Chriſt. 1. There muſt bee an high eſteeme of the perſon of Jeſus, that he is the Chriſt; for to this end was the Goſpel writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, John 20.31. <hi>That men might beleeve, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the ſon of God.</hi> 2. There muſt bee an actuall acceptance of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from Jeſus Chriſt; for, Hebr. 9.15. <hi>For this cauſe hee is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of the New Teſtament, &amp;c. That they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternall inheritance.</hi>
                           <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The &s;ubject of it nega&EOLhyphen;tively,{/NOTE --> There is in the Divels an eſtimatory faith of Chriſt; for they have acknowledged and confeſſed of Chriſt, that he is <hi>the holy one of God, and the ſon of God.</hi> See Marc. 1.24. and Marc. 3.11. And in them there is a precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory faith of Chriſt; for they yeeld to his authority, and when he commanded them out of the poſſeſſed, they obeyed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Marc. 1.26.27. And there is in them a juducatory faith in Chriſt; for they beleeve he is their Judge, who hath power to condemne and torment them, and they ſubmit unto his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; only they petition him to ſtay the execution, and not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them before the time. Compare Mat. 8.29. and Luk. 8.28. But in them there is no promiſſory faith, eyther in God or in Chriſt; not that they want will to accept Gods promiſes, but that they want promiſes to accept; for the promiſes of the Goſpel are not ordayned or made to them: becauſe they are not to be juſtified to have a preſent right to any future bleſſing, but are already condemned to have a preſent doome to a future curſe, Mat. 25.41. <hi>in everlasting fire prepared for them.</hi> And Jude 6. they now lie <hi>in everlaſting chaines untill the day of their execution.</hi> But the right ſubject of a promiſſory faith in Chriſt is man;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and affirma&EOLhyphen;tively.{/NOTE --> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the promiſes of the Goſpel, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Legacies of Gods laſt Will and Teſtament are predeſtinated, deviſed, or bequeathed unto man; and therefore man is the perſon who is to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a preſent right unto thoſe future bleſſings, and this

right man hath and acquires by the title of his faith in Jeſus Chriſt. And his faith is reſtrayned unto Jeſus Chriſt, not to exclude his faith in God, for all faith in Jeſus Chriſt, is alſo faith in God: but partly to diſtinguiſh it from all other faith in God, as from the faith of the Patriarcks which was immediate; and from the faith of the Jews which was mediate by the means of Moſes;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}4.

The other way is medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, when God declares the will of his promiſe by the meanes of a Mediatour or Meſſenger, whom God employeth on purpoſe to deliver it. Such was Gods promiſe to the Iſraelites for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of Egypt, wherein Moſes was imployed as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour or Meſſenger to deliver it, Exod. 3.16. Such was Gods promiſe to David by the meſſage of Nathan, for the eſtabliſhing of the Kingdome of Iſrael upon the ſeede of David, 2. Sam. 7.4. Such was his promiſe to the Jewes by the meſſage of the Prophet Jeremy for their returne from Captivity, Jer. 29.10. Such was Gods promiſe to Zacharias by the meſſage of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel Gabriel, that his Wife Elizabeth ſhould beare him a ſonne, Luk. 1.13. And ſuch are all Gods promiſes ſpecified in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto man by the meſſage of Jeſus Chriſt; whoſe Miniſtery is more excellent then any of the former, becauſe, Heb. 8.6. <hi>Hee is the Mediatour of a better Covenant eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Faith imme&EOLhyphen;diate,{/NOTE -->Now our faith in God muſt go Gods way; for when his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is immediate by himſelfe, our faith in him muſt bee imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, as was the faith of Noah and Abraham. But when Gods promiſe is mediate by the meanes of a Mediatour or Meſſenger, our faith in God muſt bee mediate,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and mediat,{/NOTE --> to believe in God by or through his Mediatour or Meſſenger; for by or through the Meſſenger, our faith is conveyed and arriveth at God; as by or through the Meſſenger, Gods promiſe is conveyed and arriveth at us.

whomſoever I ſend, receiveth mee; and hee that receiveth mee, receiveth him that ſent mee, i. e.</hi> believeth in him that ſent mee. And contrarily, diffiding or deſpiſing of Gods Meſſenger, is diffiding or deſpiſing of God himſelfe; as Chriſt in another Evangeliſt tells his Diſciples, Luk. 10.16. <hi>Hee that despiſeth you, despiſeth mee, and hee that despiſeth mee, despiſeth him that ſent mee, i. e.</hi> diffideth or not believeth him that ſent mee.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}whereof the Nece&s;&s;ity,{/NOTE --> For want of this mediate faith to believe in God by the meanes of his Meſſenger, God threatens a fearefull judgement upon the Jewes, Jer. 29.18. <hi>To perſecute them with the ſword, with the famine, and with the peſtilence; and to deliver them to bee removed to all the Kingdomes of the Earth, to bee a curſe and an aſtoniſhment, and a hiſſing, and a reproach among all Nations; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not hearkened to my words, ſaith the Lord, which I ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by my ſervants the Prophets, riſing up early and ſending them, but yee would not heare, i. e.</hi> yee would not believe. And for want of the like faith Zacharias was for a time ſtrucken dumbe, Luk. 1.20. becauſe hee believed not the words of the Angel Gabriel, who was a Meſſenger from God unto him.</p>
                        <p>Such a mediate faith in God had the Iſraelites,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and &s;ome Examples.{/NOTE --> who believed in Moſes; by and through whom their faith was conveyed and arrived at God. For Moſes was the Meſſenger from God, and the Mediatour of Gods Teſtament and Covenant with them. It was Gods will that the people ſhould believe him; for therefore he was to worke Miracle after Miracle before them, Ex. 4.8. and it was Gods worke, that they did believe in Moſes; for therefore the Lord ſayd unto him, Exod. 19.9. <hi>Loe, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may heare when I ſpeake with thee, and believe thee for ever;</hi> where the Originall hath it, believe <hi>in thee,</hi> though the nicety of Tranſlators ſpare to expreſſe it. For Chriſt teſtifieth of the Jewes, John. 5.45. That <hi>they truſted in Moſes.</hi> Yet this faith of theirs in Moſes was not terminated in Moſes, but in God; for God was the end in whom this faith reſted, and Moſes was the Meane through whom it paſſed. And all faith under the Goſpel is a mediate faith; for although it bee terminated in God to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and reſt in him, as in the finall object or laſt end of it: Yet it mediateth in Chriſt as the Meanes by and through whom it is carryed and conveyed unto God. For, 2.

                        <p n="2"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}2. Chri&s;t is the Authour or Worker of it,{/NOTE -->2. It is called the faith of Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour or Beginner of it, who worketh it in us, who by his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing and preaching of Gods promiſes, doth invite, call, and draw us to that acceptance of them which is our faith. For ſome may peradventure ſay, how ſhall a man know, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel come from God, and whether the beetle Will and Teſtament of God; ſeeing many things are impoſed on the World for the will of God, which either are not his will, or are not ſufficiently declared and proved to bee his will? Unto this query, the anſwer is, That Chriſt hath abundantly made full faith unto the World, both of his perſon, that hee was the Sonne of God, and of his Meſſage, that it was the Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of God, and conſequently on his part doth ſufficiently worke in us that faith, whereby wee accept the Legacies or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes therein contained and deviſed unto us. And Chriſt was the Founder or Beginner of this faith, who firſt made it unto the World. For that faith which is wrought in us by reading thoſe Evangeliſts and Apoſtles who have written the Goſpel, or by hearing thoſe Miniſters who preach the Goſpel, is but a deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and propagation of that faith, which was originally and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitively taught by Chriſt. From whom the Apoſtles and all the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſince ſucceeding, have their Commiſſion and Authority to teach it; and unto whom they are Witneſſes to atteſt that truth which was firſt teſtified by Chriſt, as the firſt perſon that made faith of it. And Chriſt hath made faith of Gods laſt Will and Teſtament, by two Acts.</p>

Yet neither the ſhame, nor the paine of his death, could force him to renounce that ſaying, but he perſiſted in it to his laſt gaſp; and then crying with a loud voyce, and commending his ſpirit unto God, <hi>he called him his Father, and gave up the ghoſt.</hi> Luk. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

For as that ſaying cauſed his death, ſo his death cauſed the faith of it; becauſe among men there As no greater proofe to make faith of a truth, then when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who averres it, doth take his death upon it. And the death of Chriſt ſeconded with ſome miracles at it, was to this purpoſe ſo effectuall, that preſently at his giving up the ghoſt, it bred the faith of this truth in the minds of many, yea in ſome of his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners; and the Centurion openly confeſſed it upon the place, ſaying, Mat. 27.54. <hi>Truly this was the ſon of God.</hi>

which Chriſt had ſingled out to take away the ſcandall of his death; that notwithſtanding the Jewes would take away his life, yet he could and would take it againe, in riſing from the grave the third day. For when firſt the faithleſſe Jewes deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ſigne of his authority, hee propoſed his Reſurrection to oppoſe the ſcandall of his deſtruction, Joh. 2.19. <hi>Deſtroy,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this temple, and in three dayes I will rayſe it up.</hi> And when he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his Diſciples of his Paſſion, hee alwayes comforted their minds againſt it by foretelling alſo his Reſurrection; Mat. 16.21. and Mat. 17.23. If therefore according to theſe Predictions his Reſurrection had not followed, then by default thereof, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and his miracles had beene diſcredited and diffided. The Reſurrection therefore of Chriſt, declared him to bee the ſonne of God, Rom. 1.4. <hi>and declared to bee the ſonne of God with power, according to the ſpirit of holineſſe, by the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> It prooved him to be the Judge of the world; which becauſe to the world it ſeemes incredible, therefore God hath made faith of it by rayſing him from the dead, Act. 17.31. <hi>Becauſe hee hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by that man whom he hath ordayned, whereof hee hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath rayſed him from the dead.</hi> This <hi>giving aſſurance</hi> heere, is making faith; for ſo is the Originall, and ſo the vulgar Italian renders it; and it is almoſt ſo in the margin of our laſt Engliſh Tranſlation, for there it is <hi>offered faith:</hi> yet the ſenſe comes all to one, becauſe all giving aſſurance is <hi>making faith.</hi> And the Reſurrection of Chriſt was of ſuch force to make faith, that the Apoſtles, who were to ſpread faith, made it the forme of their ordination, ordayning Matthias to bee an Apoſtle under this forme, Act. 1.22. <hi>To be a witneſſe with them of Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> And they made it the ſumme of their preaching; for when they began to preach that Jeſus was the Chriſt, their maine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was, <hi>that God had rayſed him from the dead.</hi> See Act. 2. and Act. 3. and Act. 4. and Act. 5. and Act. 13. For this is the very life of faith, 1. Cor. 15.17. <hi>For if Chriſt be not rayſed, your faith is vaine, ye are yet in your ſinnes.</hi> And it is the very heart of ſaving faith; for, Rom. 10.9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth, that Jeſus is the Lord, and ſhalt beleeve in thy heart, that God rayſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Shall wee not beleeve one riſen from the dead? Surely the damned are not ſo unbeleeving; for they ſeeme to beleeve, that one riſen from the dead, is the fitteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to gaine faith and beliefe. Hence Dives requeſted Abraham to ſend Lazarus to his five brethren living; for he ſuppoſed, that if one ſhould come to them from the dead, they would be more perſwaded by him, then by Moſes &amp; all the Prophets. Luk. 16.30.</p>

And can he not believe that Jeſus is the ſon of God, by whom God gives his grace? Hath he any grounds to believe in Moſes? And hath hee not far greater &amp; ſtronger for his faith in Jeſus Chriſt? for beſides the grounds &amp; arguments for faith in Chriſt, which hitherto we have mentioned, Chriſt had alſo the Teſtimonies of Moſes, and the Prophets, which were ſufficient to make faith of him, and by the indication of John the Baptiſt actually did make it in the firſt of his Diſciples; for ſay they, John 1.45. <hi>We have found him of whom Moſes in the Law and the Prophets did write.</hi> But the Incredulous Jew gives not full credit to his owne Creed; he boaſteth of Moſes, and glorieth in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and yet hee believes not the writings of Moſes; for if hee did, hee would alſo believe in Jeſus Chriſt, John. 5.46. <hi>For had ye believed Moſes, ye would have believed me, for he wrot of me.</hi>

                        <p>The Reaſon why Chriſt doth declare and prove the laſt Will and Teſtament of God, is becauſe Chriſt is the Executor of it.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}For Chri&s;t is the Execu&EOLhyphen;tor of it.{/NOTE --> Seeing that Gods Will is a Teſtament, therefore it muſt needes have an Executor, <hi>i. e.</hi> a perſon in the place or ſtead of God to performe the minde and will of God. Becauſe the nominating or appoynting of an Executor, is the very eſſence of a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which alone doth make a Will to become a Teſtament, and without which no Will eyther is or can bee rightly tearmed a Teſtament; for by the beſt Lawyers a Teſtament is defined to bee a Will, wherein an Executor is nominated. Now the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of Gods laſt Will and Teſtament is Jeſus Chriſt, who is a perſon in the place and ſtead of God, to execute and performe the will of God. For hence ſaith Chriſt, John 6.38. <hi>I came downe from Heaven, not to doe mine owne Will, but the Will of him that ſent mee,</hi> and the Will heere mentioned is Gods laſt Will and Teſtament; for in the next following verſes hee expreſſeth one clauſe of that will, containing the bleſſed Legacies of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, and Everlaſting life, deviſed or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to every believer in Chriſt. And againe the Apoſtle ſaith, Heb. 7.22. <hi>Jeſus was made a Surety of a better Teſtament, i. e.</hi> In effect the Executor of a better Teſtament; for although every Surety bee not an Executor: Yet the ſurety of a Teſtament is the very ſame with an Executor; becauſe the Executor of a Will ſtands bound for the Teſtator, to pay all his Debts, Gifts, and Legacies, as the Surety in a bond ſtands bound for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall

Debtor. And againe Chriſt profeſſeth, that hee came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World on purpoſe, to bee the Executor of Gods laſt Will and Teſtament, Heb. 10.9. <hi>Then ſayd hee, Loe I come to doe thy Will, O God;</hi> for by Gods will heere is meant his laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even that will; whereby <hi>hee tooke away the firſt Will, that hee might eſtabliſh the ſecond,</hi> as plainely appeares by the reſt of the words in that verſe. Now it is the office of the Executor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and prove the Will and Teſtament of the Teſtator.

For in ſuch Wills and Teſtaments, becauſe the Legataries are ſo numerous, that they cannot all bee perſonally and particularly nominated by their proper or ſingle names, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not only neceſſary, but ſufficient and valid, to nominate them in generall by ſome name appellative or common to them all; as to the Poore of ſuch a Towne, or to the Priſoners of ſuch a Goale. For thereby every poore Perſon of that Towne, and every Priſoner of that Goale, is truly named in that Will; not by his ſingle or proper name, but by ſuch a name appellative or common, as doth ſufficiently certifie and deſigne him out. And ſuch an appellative nomination is valid and good to convey and ſettle upon him a right to the Legacy deviſed unto him; which every poore Perſon of that Towne, may juſtly claime by the title of his poverty; and every Priſoner of that Goale by the title of his impriſonment.

For heare what Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, John 3.36. <hi>Hee that believeth on the Sonne hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, i. e.</hi> is juſtified unto everlaſting life; for a Believer upon the act of his beliefe hath not everlaſting life actually, but

John. 5.12. <hi>Hee that hath the Sonne, hath life, i. e.</hi> hath a preſent right to the future poſſeſſion of it, or (which is all one) is juſtified unto it. And againe, John 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave hee power to become the Sons of God, i. e.</hi> Chriſt did juſtifie them, by adopting them, or by giving them a preſent right to become the ſons of God; for all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopting is Juſtifying, but not contrarily; becauſe adoption is but one kinde and the nobleſt kinde of Juſtification.</p>
                        <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}in re&s;pect of God,{/NOTE -->Yet this act of Chriſt in Juſtifying us, is but miniſteriall unto God; for God is the Authour or principall perſon in our Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and Chriſt is the Mediatour or Miniſter by, or through whom God doth juſtifie us. Unto us our Juſtifying is free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee uſe no meanes for it: But God uſeth a meanes for it, and that meanes is through Chriſt, Rom. 3.24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And eternall life is the gift of God; but that gift is handed unto us, through Jeſus Chriſt, Rom. 6.23. <hi>but the gift of God is eternall life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> The Promiſes whereto wee are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſhew the exceeding riches of Gods grace and kindeneſſe: But his grace and kindeneſſe towards us is through Jeſus Chriſt, Epheſ. 2.7. <hi>That in the Ages to come, hee might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindeneſſe towards us through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And God hath appoynted us to obtaine ſalvation; but wee muſt obtaine it through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1. Theſſ. 5.9. <hi>For God hath not appoynted us to wrath, but to obtaine ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hence Chriſt ſaith of his Doctrin, John 7.16. <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent mee, i. e.</hi> The Doctrine hee taught was his Fathers, principally for the framing of it, and his Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the teaching of it.

And hee ſaith of himſelfe, Mat. 20.28. <hi>The Sonne of man came not to bee miniſtered unto, but to miniſter.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith of him, Rom. 15.8. <hi>Now I ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion for the truth of God.</hi> Hence alſo his Mediatorſhip of the New Teſtament is called his Miniſtery, Heb. 8.6. <hi>But now hath hee obtained a more excellent Miniſtery, by how much alſo hee is the Mediatour of a better Teſtament eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes.</hi>
                           <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}by confirm&EOLhyphen;ing Gods Will.{/NOTE -->
                        </p>
                        <p>And the Miniſteriall Acts whereby Chriſt doth juſtifie us, are chiefely two. 1. By confirming Gods Will and Teſtament;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62812:113"/>
thereby to eſtabliſh and ſettle upon us our preſent right or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to the Legacies or Promiſes thereof. Upon the act of our faith in accepting the promiſes, our preſent right to the bleſſings promiſed becomes firme and ſure; for it is the nature of faith to put a <hi>fiat</hi> to the promiſes accepted by making them firme and ſure. But in a matter of ſuch moment as is an inheritance to Heaven, it is fit that ſomething more ſhould bee done on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſers part, to make the promiſe thereof more firme and more ſure, by confirming and aſſuring it. For a Promiſe may by the Promiſer bee revoked and voyded, untill by him it bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: But being once by him confirmed, it becomes irrevocable and unchangeable; becauſe his act of Confirmation doth defeat and extinguiſh in him all power to revoke it. And thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which in a Will or Teſtament are framed into Legacies, whatſoever the faith of the Legatary bee to accept them, are of no force at all, untill the Teſtament bee confirmed; for untill a confirmation of it, it is alwayes in the power of the Teſtator to alter it at his pleaſure. Now the perſon who makes this confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Gods Teſtament, and of the promiſes therein deviſed, is Jeſus Chriſt; for of him the Prophet foretells it, Dan. 9.27. <hi>And hee ſhall confirme the Covenant with many for one Weeke;</hi> or in the beginning of his laſt Weeke. And the Apoſtle teſtifies, Rom. 15.8. That Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter for the truth of God on purpoſe, <hi>to confirme the promiſes made unto the Fathers.</hi> And the Meanes whereby Chriſt confirmes Gods Will and Teſtament, is by his death; becauſe all wills and teſtaments are confirmed by death, as at the laſt verſe of this Chapter ſhall more largely bee declared.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond act whereby Chriſt is miniſteriall to God in our Juſtifying, that it may take effect in us,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and by Per&EOLhyphen;forming it,{/NOTE --> is the Performance of Gods Will and Teſtament, and of the promiſes therein contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; by delivering or giving us poſſeſſion of that future bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which by vertue of Gods promiſe is deviſed unto us, and whereto by faith we have a preſent right or intereſt. For as God by the Meanes of Chriſt, doth confirme his Teſtament and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; ſo by the ſame Chriſt he performes them; and wee from Chriſt muſt expect them, by placing in him all our hope and truſt for this performance. For after the deviſe or grant of a promiſe, there remaine on the promiſers part no more acts to bee done, but only theſe two, namely to Confirme his promiſe, and to Performe it. And by this latter act, all promiſes are finiſhed, to have their finall and laſt effect; for the verity or truth of the promiſer, which is concealed and may bee doubted in the grant of the promiſe, doth cleerly and fully appear in the performance.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62812:114"/>
Unleſſe therefore there bee a full performance of Gods promiſe, by a future delivery and poſſeſſion of that inheritance, whereto by faith we have now a preſent right, then both God failes of his truth, and wee of our right. For when a promiſe is conveyed unto mee in the beſt and ſureſt manner, by being deviſed or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed unto mee by way of Legacy or Gift in a Will, and the Will bee alſo confirmed: Yet if it bee not performed, what benefit have I by a promiſe ſo deviſed? Now the perſon who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the promiſes of Gods laſt Will and Teſtament, is Jeſus Chriſt; for by and through him all the promiſes of God have the verity and truth of their performance, 2. Cor. 1.20. <hi>For all the promiſes of God, in him are yea, and in him Amen, i. e.</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and fullfilled by Chriſt, who thereby doth perfect the verity and truth of them, Yea Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, that hee might bee inabled with full power to performe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of our Juſtifying, Rom. 4.25. <hi>And was raiſed againe for our Juſtification, i. e.</hi> to performe the promiſes whereto wee are juſtified; for as hee was delivered unto death to Confirme the promiſes: So hee was raiſed againe to performe them.</p>
                        <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}for Chri&s;t is the Executor of it,{/NOTE -->The Reaſon why Chriſt doth Performe Gods laſt Will and Teſtament, and the Promiſes or Legacies therein contained, is becauſe (as was before ſhewed) Chriſt is the Executor thereof. It is the office of the Executor to execute or performe the will of the Teſtator; for as it is his office to declare the nature of the will, and to Prove the verity of it: So his finall office (whereto the former are but mediall) is to Performe the Legacies of it. Otherwiſe the Faithfull who are the Legataries in Gods Will and Teſtament, and who therein are Co-heires with the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, have no meanes nor hope to attaine and poſſeſſe the precious Legacies therein deviſed and bequeathed unto them. Becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have their right and claime by the good will and gift of the Teſtator: Yet of themſelves they have no ability to take or ſeize upon their Legacies. For what ability have the Dead to raiſe themſelves from the duſt of their corruption and rottenneſſe unto celeſtiall and glorious bodies, whereby to aſcend into Heaven, and take poſſeſſion of that Kingdome? Or what ability have the Living to transforme or change their bodies earthly and mortall into bodies heavenly and immortall? Or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Legatary hath <hi>ability</hi> to take his Legacy of himſelf, as in humane wills hee many times hath: Yet regularly hee hath no <hi>authority</hi> to doe it; for if hee doe, hee doth in many caſes forfeit it.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}on whom all Believers de&EOLhyphen;pend.{/NOTE --> The courſe therefore of the Legatary is to addreſſe himſelfe unto the Executor, to whom hee muſt make ſuit for the Legacy, that in due manner hee may receive the poſſeſſion of it,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62812:114"/>
from him who is to deliver it, according to the will and minde of the Teſtator. Partly becauſe the Executor being the Mediator, or mediall perſon betweene the Teſtator and the Legatary, muſt firſt be poſſeſſed of the Teſtators eſtate, that thereby he may be enabled to deliver the Legacies thence iſſuing; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe a Legacy (according to the definition and nature of it) is a gift left by the Teſtator, to be delivered or performed by the Executor. Seeing then Chriſt is the Executor of Gods laſt Will and Teſtament, therefore his Office it is to execute and performe it, by delivering unto the Faithfull the poſſeſſion of thoſe bleſſed Legacies, whereto by vertue of Gods Will they are juſtified. Thus Chriſt is the Beginner of our faith,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Recollectio&cmbAbbrStroke;.{/NOTE --> by working in us our acceptance of Gods Promiſes: and he is the Finiſher of our faith, by performing unto us the Promiſes which we have accepted; for hence he is called (Hebr. 12.2.) <hi>the Athour and Finiſher of our faith.</hi>

Formerly it hath beene ſhewed, that the word Juſtified hath in the Scripture ſeverall ſenſes; the Apoſtle therefore have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the former parts of this verſe taken this word in a jurall ſence, for the imputing or conveying of a right, intereſt, or claim, doth now in this laſt clauſe take the ſame word in a legall ſenſe, for declaring or pronouncing upright, innocent, or ſinleſſe. For when a word doth beare ſeverall ſenſes, and the Apoſtle hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it in ſome one ſenſe, hee loves for the greater elegancy, to repeate the ſame word againe in another ſenſe, if the matter will admit it, as heere it will and doth; for otherwiſe wee faile of the Apoſtles intent, and loſe all the force of his argument.

But if the ſenſe be varied as we have gloſſed it, then will this latter clauſe bee a pregnant proofe of the former, and conſequently it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſuit with the ſcope and minde of the Apoſtle.

So that Paul hath in a manner explained the ſenſe of Davids ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in adding theſe words, <hi>by the workes of the Law.</hi> The reaſon therefore whereby the Apoſtle argues heere,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The Propo&EOLhyphen;&s;ition of the Rea&s;on,{/NOTE --> ſeemes to runne thus. If a man will bee jurally juſtified by the workes of the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> If hee will clayme from God a preſent right to the future Inheritance of Heaven by the title of his workes; then God entring into judgement with him, and in the ſight or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, hee muſt by his workes bee legally juſtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> Hee muſt bee declared or pronounced upright and innocent, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have beene an offendor againſt any Law of God. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing but not granting, that it is an effect or worke of the Law, to Juſtifie a man jurally, <hi>i. e.</hi> To give him a preſent right to the future Inheritance of Heaven: Yet certainely the Law cannot produce this effect, but onely in thoſe, who by the workes of the Law are legally juſtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> Are declared upright and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in the ſight and knowledge of God. For if in the ſight of God a man bee found an offender or peccant againſt any one Law of God, then in that caſe the effect or worke of the Law upon him, is to Condemne him, by imputing unto him a preſent guilt of a future puniſhment; which is an effect quite contrary
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62812:116"/>
to that of jurall Juſtifying, which imputes a preſent right to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bleſſing. For ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 4.15. <hi>The Law worketh wrath, i. e.</hi> It is an effect or worke of the Law, to bring the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of death upon every tranſgreſſour of it; though hee offend but in ſome one poynt of it, as it is expreſſed, Jam. 2.10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keepe the whole Law, and yet offend in one poynt, hee is guilty of all, i. e.</hi> Hee that offends againſt one ſingle Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the penalty is death, is in as bad a caſe, as if hee had offended againſt all; for by the breach of that one Law hee is guilty of death; and of more puniſhment hee could not bee guilty, if hee had beene guilty of breaking all the reſt: Becauſe death is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment, beyond which there is no other.</p>
                        <p>But (to come now to the Aſſumption) though before men at their ſeats of Judgement,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the A&s;&s;ump&EOLhyphen;tion.{/NOTE --> in their ſight and knowledge of the cauſe, ſome man may be and hath beene legally juſtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> declared upright and innocent; for in this ſence Paul teſtifies of himſelfe, Phil. 3.6. that <hi>touching the righteouſneſſe which is in the Law</hi> he was <hi>blameleſſe;</hi> not that hee was blameleſſe in the ſight and knowledge of God; but in the knowledge of men, and of his owne conſcience, in that neyther himſelfe, nor any other man could iuſtly lay any legall blame unto him: and in this ſenſe God himſelfe teſtifies of Job, Job. 1.8. that <hi>hee was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and an upright man:</hi> yet Gods teſtimony of Job muſt not be ſo underſtood, as if Job were perfect and upright in the ſight and knowledge of God; for that ſenſe Job himſelfe doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſclaime: but God ſaw and knew Job to be perfect and upright in the ſight and knowledge of men, in that no man could charge him with the breach of any Law; and the like ſenſe is to be conceived of Zacharias and Elizabeth, of whom it is reported, Luk. 1.6. that <hi>they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandements and ordinances of the Lord blameleſſe.</hi> Yet before God, at his ſeat of Judgement, or upon his ſight and knowledge of the cauſe, no man living (except Jeſus Chriſt) ever was, or ever ſhall be Legally juſtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> declared and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced perfect and upright, to be a man ſinleſſe, and blameleſſe, no way peccant againſt any Law of God. For by the ſentence of God delivered in the Scriptures, all men living of what Nation or Religion ſoever, are declared ſinners againſt his law and guilty of death. For ſuch are the Gentiles declared, who had not the law, but in doing by nature the things contayned in the law, were a law unto themſelves: and ſuch are the Jewes declared, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the law and made their boaſt of God. See Rom. cap. 1. and cap. 2. <hi>per totum.</hi> Yea the Jewes are declared <hi>in no wiſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Gentiles, but of both it is proved, that they were all under ſin,</hi>
                           <pb n="224" facs="tcp:62812:117"/>
Rom. 3.9. And the end of that declaration is, to ſtop all mouths, and to find all the world guilty, Rom. 3.19. <hi>that every mouth might be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God:</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that guiltineſſe is, becauſe all have ſinned, Rom. 3.23. <hi>For all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> But the finall or laſt end of that Declaration is, that mans right to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Heaven ſhould come by promiſe and gift, and his title to that right ſhould bee by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, Gal. 3.22. <hi>But the Scripture hath concluded all under ſinne,</hi> that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, might bee given to them that believe.</p>
                        <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and the Con&EOLunhyphen;clu&s;ion.{/NOTE -->Therefore (to adde the Concluſion) no man living ſhall bee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally juſtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> Shall have a preſent right to the future eſtate of bleſſedneſſe, by the title of his workes. The ſumme of the Apoſtles argument is briefely thus: If a man have a right to everlaſting life by the title of his workes, then hee muſt by his workes in the ſight of God bee declared upright: But no man living can by his workes in the ſight of God be declared upright: Therefore no man living can have a right to everlaſting life by the title of his workes. This is the debility of mans workes, if wee conſider them as a title whereby hee acquires and hath that right: But if wee conſider them as a tenure wherby hee preſerves and holds his right, then they may and muſt be of ſome efficacy, as will appear afterward in this Chapter at the 18. verſe.</p>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62812:117"/>
Juſtification by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the workes of the Law; for againſt that Doctrine ſome men did or might argue thus. Yee that are Jewes by nature ſeeke to bee juſtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> ye ſeeke a ſtate of divine liberty or freedome, whereby yee have a preſent right to the future poſſeſſion of heavenly bleſſedneſſe, whereof one particular is, the Pardon of all your ſinnes paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come. And yee ſeeke this right by the title of your faith in Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> By your high eſteeme of him for the ſonne of God, and by your acceptance of thoſe promiſes wherein hee gives this divine ſtate. And yee make this faith your ſole and onely title, excluding all workes of the Law from any concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence therewith. But while yee have this preſent right to bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſeeke the future poſſeſſion of it by faith onely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by yee are certaine and aſſured of it; then hence it will follow, that in the meane time yee may continue in ſinfullneſſe, living in all kind of licentiouſneſſe, as the ſinners of the Gentiles lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their acceſſe unto Chriſt. And it ſeemes yee make account to live thus; becauſe yee ſpeake ſo much againſt the Law, which would bridle yee from ſinne, and becauſe yee diſclaime the works thereof from being any part of the title, whereby yee acquire this right, reſtraining your title to faith onely. And in caſe you doe live thus by continuing your life in ſinfullneſſe; it will thence further follow, that Chriſt who gave you this liberty did thereby give you a licence to ſinne, and conſequently did open a doore and miniſter an occaſion to all wickedneſſe. For the word Sinne in this place muſt bee underſtood, not generally for any ſmall degree of ſinne, by way of errour or frailty (for in ſuch ſinnes the faithfull doe, and cannot but continue in this life;) but ſpecially and eminently for a high degree and conſtant courſe of wickedneſſe and lewdneſſe, as Perjuries, Murthers, Adulteries, Thefts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from which ſort of ſinnes all that are truely faithful, may and muſt abſtaine in this life.</p>

neither, but retaining both. For they ſuppoſing that the Goſpel of Chriſt was but an addition or ſuperſtruction unto the Law of Moſes, did confidently teach, that the workes of the Law were the entrance and the way unto faith in Chriſt; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they urged the workes thereof, principally Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to bee retained by the believing Jewes, and to bee impoſed upon the believing Gentiles, as things neceſſary to Juſtification, and ſalvation; as it appeares Acts 15.1. And theſe Judaizers did by vertue of this objection ſpread their falſe Doctrine againſt Juſtification by faith onely, in the Churches of Judea, of Syria, of Galatia, and of Italy; for in the Epiſtle to the Romans wee finde the Apoſtle copiouſly refelling this objection; and wee finde the like in the generall Epiſtle of St. John.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}for 2 Incon&EOLhyphen;veniences.{/NOTE --> The Matter of this objection containes two inconvenient or abſurd Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which the urgers thereof conceived would neceſſarily follow upon the Doctrine of Juſtification by faith onely without works. 1.

And this elegant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of Perſonation in changing the perſon of his diſcourſe was with Paul ſo familiar, that he would attribute unto himſelfe, ſometime really that perſon which indeed he was, as heere hee doth, continuing ſo to the end of this Chapter: and ſometime verbally by way of fiction, that perſon which indeed he was not; as hee doth Rom. 7.7. through a great part of that Chapter; where in his owne perſon hee ſpeakes of a man under the Law and adhering thereto; which then was not his condition. But in the laſt verſe of that Chapter and Chap. 8.2. hee changeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and in his owne perſon ſpeakes of himſelfe according to that condition wherein he then was.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the Scope of it.{/NOTE -->The Scope or purpoſe of this Anſwer is this, that By vertue of my Juſtification I may and muſt mortifie and deſtroy in my ſelfe the acts and luſts of ſin. For this worke although it be not the title whereby I acquire and have my Juſtification, or that Divine alliance with God whereto I am Juſtified: yet it is the tenure whereby I preſerve and hold it. This worke if I neglect, I forfeit the ſtate of my Divine alliance, and loſe the benefit of my Juſtification. For by my continuance in the acts of ſin, I become a moſt ſinfull ſinner, in abuſing the pardon and grace of God in building againe my ſtate in ſin, and in binding my ſelfe over to eternall death. And the guilt of this my ſinfulnes lyes wholly upon my ſelfe, and not upon Chriſt who juſtified mee; and therefore Chriſt cannot be called the miniſter of my ſin, or any way the occaſion thereof. But if upon my relapſe into ſin, and my continuance therein, Chriſt ſhould notwithſtanding continue my ſtate of juſtification, keepe up my divine alliance with him, and at laſt, give me eternall life, then indeed he might be accounted the miniſter of ſin. We may hereupon eaſily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that in this Anſwer is compriſed and couched in a maner, the ſum of the whole ſixt chapter to the Romans. For the very ſame objection urged here in the former verſe, is diſcuſſed and diſſolved there, in a diſcourſe more diffuſive and ample. For in reſpect of the maine Argument, this Epiſtle to the Galatians is of that to the Romans a kinde of Breviat; as by the collation of many paſſages in both may plainly appeare.</p>

                        <hi>FOR if I build againe, the things which I deſtroyed.]</hi> The ſtate wherein I ſtood before my Juſtification, was a ſtate of ſinne, a baſe, low, and terrene ſtate of ſpirituall bondage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I was a ſtranger to God, a ſlave to ſinne, and the ſonne of death. For I was not onely Calamitous, or a <hi>quaſi</hi>-ſinner, tainted by the attainder of Adam: But I was a tranſgreſſour againſt the rules of Gods written Law; and I was improbous, and many wayes peccant againſt the rules of equity and morality.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}My ju&s;tifica&EOLhyphen;tio&cmbAbbrStroke; de&s;troys my &s;tate of &s;inne,{/NOTE --> But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Juſtification my ſtate of ſinne was deſtroyed and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. For my Juſtification doth erect and build unto mee a ſtate quite contrary to the former, namely, a ſtate of Right, which makes mee jurally righteous, to have a divine right, a high, noble and heavenly ſtate of divine liberty and allyance, whereby I am made a Freeman of Heaven, in the beſt and higheſt degree, to bee the Sonne and Heire of God. When a Slave is infranchiſed, his ſtate of ſlavery is thereby extinguiſhed: So when a Sinner is juſtified his ſtate of ſinne is thereby actually deſtroyed; becauſe theſe two ſtates are ſo contrary and inconſiſtent, that in one and the ſame perſon, at one and the ſame time, they cannot both ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
                     <p>Yet upon my Juſtification, the paſſions, motions,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}&amp; how far:{/NOTE --> or luſts of my ſinne are not deſtroyed <hi>in facto eſſe;</hi> for I finde in my ſoule that they ſtill remaine and ſtruggle in mee, and by ſome of them I am ſometime worſted. And yet againe even theſe motions and luſts are alſo deſtroyed <hi>in fieri, i. e.</hi> They are in a good courſe, and in a ready way to be actuall deſtroyed; for their dominion and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is already deſtroyed; ſo that they cannot (as formerly they did) over-maſter and compell me to the acts of ſinne. And the worke of their deſtruction <hi>in fieri</hi> is deſigned unto mee, as my ſervice <hi>to righteouſneſſe unto holyneſſe.</hi> For unto this worke Chriſt who juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied mee by my faith, doth thereby oblige mee; and unto this worke Chriſt who ſanctified mee by his ſpirit, doth thereto ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me.</p>
                     <p>But after my Juſtification, if through the ſubtilty of Satan,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}But relap&s;e into &s;in de&EOLhyphen;&s;troys my Ju&s;tification,{/NOTE --> or through the pravity of mine owne ſoule, I ſhall ſuffer my ſelfe to bee perſwaded, that either there is no bond upon mee, or no power in mee to performe this worke of mortifying and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paſſions, motions, and luſts of my ſinne, and thereupon ſhall either neglect this worke, or fall to a worke quite contrary in ſerving the paſſions, motions, and luſts of my ſinne, unto the acts of ſinne; not acts of ignorance and infirmity, but of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity or wickedneſſe (for theſe three kindes or degrees of ſinne muſt alwayes bee noted and diſcerned;) Then by my ſinfull acts
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62812:120"/>
I deſtroy my ſtate of Juſtification; which although by good works I could never build, yet by evil workes I may deſtroy; for by them I dedignifie and make my ſelfe unworthy of it. Yet by them I deſtroy it not for the ſeed and root of it;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}&amp; how far:{/NOTE --> for this ſhall alwayes remaine a truth, that I had once a divine liberty and alliance, whereby I was a Free-man of Heaven, and the Son of God; and poſſibly before I dye, I may recover this ſtate againe. But by ſinfull acts I deſtroy this ſtate for the fruit, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and priviledges of it: for during that condition I ſhall never enjoy that future eſtate of bleſſednes, whereto I had once a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent right; nor ſhall I ever poſſeſſe that inheritance whereto I was once a co-heyre with Chriſt. For my faith which was live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectuall to procure my preſent right to bleſſednes, doth by my evill workes become dead, voyd, and of no effect to the future poſſeſſion of it. Hence the Apoſtle asketh me, 1 Cor. 6.9. if I <hi>know not</hi> this, <hi>that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God;</hi> and he chargeth me to <hi>Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor idolaters, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankinde, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> And the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath told me, Gal. 5.21. that <hi>they who doe the workes of the fleſh, ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God. And this I know,</hi> Epheſ. 5.5. that <hi>no whoremonger nor uncleane perſon, nor covetous man who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt and of God: let no man deceive me with vaine words &amp;c.</hi> And by my ſinfull acts I deſtroy not only my ſtate of Right, but moreover by them I build againe my ſtate of ſin; for one ſinfull act added to another doth at laſt build a habit of ſin, as one ſtone upon another doth build an habitation. Or one ſingle act alone without any more, if the ſin be heinous and foule, is enough to caſt me into the ſtate of ſin.</p>

                        <hi>I make my ſelfe a tranſgreſſor.]</hi> By building againe my ſtate of ſin, I become a <hi>tranſgreſſor. i. e.</hi> an exceeding ſinfull ſinner, and a treble offendor againſt God; by ſinning firſt againſt his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law, and then againſt the rules of equity, and thirdly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the grace of his mercy, by a wilfull relapſe into that ſtate of ſin, which he had gratiouſly pardoned. For the word <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor</hi> is not heere taken ſimply for one who commits ſome one act of ſin againſt the Law: but for one who after pardon relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth into ſin, and thereby drawes upon himſelfe the guilt of his ſin, and bindes himſelfe over to the puniſhment of it, without all hope of remedy by the ordinary courſe of Gods mercy.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}(Tran&s;gre&s;&EOLhyphen;&s;or is oppo&EOLhyphen;&s;ed to the Ju&s;tified.){/NOTE --> For the <hi>tranſgreſſor</hi> heere is oppoſed not onely to the Juſt, who is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally and morally righteous, but alſo to the juſtified, who is

jurally righteous. Am I not by this relapſe a revolter from God, and a traytor to him, when after my amity, and alliance with him, I deſert him and ſide with his enemy, defrauding God of his ſervices to beſtow them upon Satan? And am I not a felon to my ſelfe, to rob my ſelfe of all my right to eternall life, and caſt away my ſelfe to eternall death? For doth not the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions teach mee, that by ſuch facts as theſe, any eſtate becomes forfeit? and doth not the light of Reaſon teach me, that if my Tenure faile, my eſtate muſt needs eſcheat? And doth not the ſacred Scripture teach me, that my laſt ſtate in ſin is worth then the firſt? For doth ſhe not playnely tell me, Hebr. 10.26. that <hi>If I ſin wilfully after that I have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſinne: but a certaine fearfull looking far of Judgement and fiery indignation which ſhall devoure the adverſaries?</hi> And againe, 2 Pet. 2.21. that <hi>it had been better for me, not to have knowne the way of righteouſnes, then after I have knowne it; to turne from the holy Commandement delivered unto me?</hi> Doth ſhe not cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare this unto me by the horrid and loathſome compariſons of a houſe haunted with an uncleane ſpirit, <hi>who being caſt out, and re-admitted, doth re-enter with ſeven other spirits more wicked than himſelfe?</hi> Luk. 11.24. <hi>Of a Dog licking up his vomit againe; and of a Som, that after waſhing, walloweth in the mire.</hi> 2. Pet. 2.22.</p>
                     <p>Yet Chriſt who juſtified me,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}yet Chri&s;t is no cau&s;e of it,{/NOTE --> is no miniſter to my ſin by juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying me; neither is it hee that makes mee a tranſgreſſor. For the right of Impunity or forgivenes of ſins, which is one of the Priviledges whereto Chriſt juſtified mee, gives mee no licenſe to ſin. As in the family, the right of Impunity which the ſon hath above the ſervant, not to be ejected or puniſhed for every fault, as the ſervant may, doth give the ſon this Priviledge in faults onely, ſuch as are ignorances and infirmities: but excuſeth him not in crimes, ſuch as are malignities, wickedneſſes, and wilfull miſdemeanors. But if the ſon will abuſe his Priviledge of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſhall thereupon run into preſumptuous and wilfull offences: can wee charge the Father as the Miniſter to his ſin, that hee makes his ſon a tranſgreſſor? Was ever any Father, who duly corrected his ſon (though he puniſhed him not) menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in ſuch a caſe as this? The like may bee ſayd of a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, who after pardon relapſeth into the ſame or the like crime, whereby his offence is highly aggravated; can wee charge his relapſe upon the Prince, who in mercy granted the pardon to him? Or when a bondſlave, whom his Lord hath infranchiſed, ſhall afterward ſell himſelfe for a ſlave; can any man in reaſon charge his latter ſlavery upon his firſt Lord, who ſet him at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>

                        <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}but I my &s;elf am the cau&s;e of it,{/NOTE -->It is not Chriſt then who makes mee a Tranſgreſſour; for my tranſgreſſion is wholly againſt his will; againſt the will of his Precepts, wherein hee forbids it, and againſt the will of his Judgements, wherein hee threatens it with eternall death. And my tranſgreſſion is wholly againſt his deedes; for in Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying mee by faith, hee hath ſtrongly obliged mee againſt it; and in ſanctifying mee by his holy ſpirit, hee hath ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled mee againſt it. What greater proviſion can Chriſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly make againſt my tranſgreſſion? What greater obligation from it, could hee lay upon mee, then the menace of eternall death in caſe I commit ſinne; and the promiſe of eternall life in caſe I refraine and deſtroy it in mee? What greater ability in this life can I have to refraine and deſtroy it, then the Power of his holy ſpirit alwayes reſident in mee to inlighten, ſtrengthen, aſſiſt, and ſuccour mee againſt it?

For what greater ſtrength more can poſſibly bee added to my faith, then ſuch an infinite engagement, and ſuch a powerfull aſſiſtance? But my true and ſtrong faith wants life and efficacy; or rather I want will enough to give it life and efficacy. Yet I have will enough to give it life and efficacy paſſively, to Accept thoſe Promiſes and Legacies of Gods Will and Teſtament, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I am juſtified. But I will not give it life and efficacy actively, to Performe thoſe Precepts and Conditions of Gods Will and Teſtament, whereto I am ſanctified, that it may become a faith working by love. Heereby it comes to paſſe, that my true and ſtrong faith comes not to be a lively, active, working and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all faith: But remaines a dead, idle, lazie, and ſlothfull faith;

and this deadneſſe, idleneſſe, lazineſſe, and ſlothfulneſſe of my faith, is the unfaithfulnes of it.</p>
                     <p>For God promiſeth unto mee a preſent right of divine alliance and inheritance to bee his Sonne and Heire to eternall bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and I by faith Accept this promiſe,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}in not per&EOLhyphen;forming my promi&s;e.{/NOTE --> and am thereupon actually in that divine ſtate of a Sonne and Heire to God. This Acceptance is my paſſive or taking faith; and by this acceptance I doe againe on my part repromiſe unto God, that I will perform the workes, duties, offices, and ſervices of a Sonne and Heire, to love, honour, and obey my heavenly Father. This promiſe I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely make, though really I neither mention it in words, nor mentally conceive it in my heart; for my act in accepting that right doth naturally and jurally according to the nature and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the thing, make this promiſe for mee, though my tongue and heart bee never ſo ſilent. And the ſtate of a Sonne and Heire wherein I ſtand, doth naturally engage and oblige mee, not onely to make this promiſe, but alſo to performe it. For hee that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of any beneficiary ſtate or condition, doth <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by promiſe to performe the workes, duties, offices, and ſervices unto that ſtate appertaining and incident.

Seeing experience teacheth mee, that there are promiſes, obligations, and engagements, as well naturall as civill, and as well tacite as expreſſe. Now, if my faith be not lively and active to performe that promiſe of love, honour, and obedience, which I on my part have made to God; or if my faith be ſo dead, idle, lazy, and ſlothfull, that ſhe will not, or doth not performe it; this non-performance of my promiſe to God, is the unfaithfulneſſe of my faith; and this unfaithfulneſſe is one default, by reaſon wherof I come to make my ſelfe a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor againſt my Juſtification.</p>

But the mutability thereof is poſſible; for manifeſt it is, that it may bee not defeated and not deſtroyed: becauſe God hath given mee the ſtate of a ſon and heyre by way of perpetuity for ever, to continue not onely for my life, but after death. When I am dead and diſſolved into duſt, God ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth my Father and my God; for hee acknowledgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, who are long ſince

dead. And from the Dead he will rayſe mee at the laſt day, to put me in poſſeſſion of that inheritance, whereto I am now an heyre.

How can I make my ſelfe a tranſgreſſour againſt my Juſtification? How can I have a firſt and a laſt eſtate, which are both evill, and the laſt worſe then the firſt? But I finde by good Hiſtory, and by ſad experience, that ſtates of perpetuity have been defeated and deſtroyed. That many a man who hath had an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in fee ſimple, to him and his Heirs for ever, and yet by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe a tranſgreſſour againſt his Lord, hath forfeited that eſtate. That many a woman who was married for life, till death ſhould depart her husband and her; and yet by making her ſelfe a tranſgreſſour againſt her husband, hath been divorced and loſt her dower. That many a ſonne who was Heire apparent to his Fathers eſtate; and yet by making himſelfe a tranſgreſſour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Father hath been diſinherited. And that the like is poſſible concerning my ſtate, the Scriptures teach mee three ways. 1. By ſerious Exhortations to take heed of making my ſelfe a tranſgreſſour. See John 5.14. and Rom. 11.20. and 1. Cor. 10.12. and 1. Tim. 1.19. and Heb. 3.12. and 1. Pet. 2.11. 2. By lively Demonſtrations of my danger, in caſe I make my ſelfe ſo. See Mat. 12.43.44. and Heb. 6.4. and Heb. 10.26.27. and 2. Pet. 2.20. 3. By ſeverall Examples of perſons who have made themſelves ſo; as Aaron, David, Solomon, the whole Kingdome of Iſrael, and the Nation of the Jewes. Which Examples doe neceſſarily conclude, that my tranſgreſſion is poſſible, and my Juſtification mutable: Becauſe of a thing impoſſible, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible there ſhould be any example.</p>

For, Jam. 2.24. This Aſſertion, that <hi>A man is juſtified by workes, and not by faith alone,</hi> is the language and word of God, as well as this, that <hi>A man is not juſtified by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For the Scripture delivereth both theſe aſſertions, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning neither of them obviouſly as it were <hi>in tranſitu:</hi> But hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling both equally, purpoſely, and by way of doctrine; for ſhee propoſeth both, and preſſeth both, inſiſteth upon both, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both by ſeverall arguments, and illuſtrating both by Similies and examples.

                     <p>In this ſenſe James affirmeth,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}as James af&EOLhyphen;firms,{/NOTE --> that <hi>A man is juſtified by workes and not by faith alone.</hi> Which aſſertion hee prooves three ſeverall wayes. 1. By two reaſons, whereof one is, Becauſe <hi>faith without workes is dead. i. e.</hi> the act of faith in juſtifying is fruſtrate, voyd,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and Proves by Rea&s;ons,{/NOTE --> and of no effect: as a Bill, Bond, or other writing whereto there is no hand nor ſeale. For a man juſtified by faith, if his faith be not ſeconded by workes to continue and maintaine his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſhall never poſſeſſe and enjoy that heavenly inheritance, whereto hee was by faith juſtified; and his faith falling of this effect, is therefore voyd or dead. The other reaſon is, Becauſe <hi>faith working with workes, is by workes made perfect. i. e.</hi> faith alone by it ſelfe is a thing imperfect and ineffectuall; for in Juſtifying, it doth but commence, begin, and enter the ſtate of Juſtification, and conſequently it createth but an imperfect and weake right; namely, a right of Inſtitution, and Expectation, a right of a ſon and heyre, a right of intereſt, clayme, and hope, a right eſcheatable and defeaſable that may poſſibly bee deſtroyed.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, he proves it by two Similyes or compariſons;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}By Similies,{/NOTE --> <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of one is, that Faith alone without workes is like the Devils Faith; for they have a kinde of faith, whereby they believe the exiſtence and unity of God. And their faith is alone without workes; namely without good and holy workes: but they are
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62812:125"/>
not without evill and wicked workes; and their faith with evill workes hath this evill worke upon them, that it makes them to tremble. The other Simily is, that faith alone without workes is like the body without breath; for <hi>as the body without breath is dead: ſo faith without works is dead alſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and Exam&EOLhyphen;ples:{/NOTE -->Thirdly, hee proves it by two Examples; One of Abraham; <hi>Was not Abraham our father juſtified by workes, when he had offered Iſaac his ſon upon the Altar? i. e.</hi> The Juſtification of Abraham conſtituted long before by his faith, whereby was imputed unto him a right of alliance and amity to bee and bee called the friend of God; was it not afterward continued by his worke in offering his ſon? for was not that worke wrought by his faith? and was not his faith and the Scripture mentioning it, fulfilled by that worke? The other example is of Rahab; <hi>Likewiſe alſo was not Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, when ſhe had received the Meſſengers and had ſent them out another way? i. e.</hi> The Juſtification of Rahab conſtituted long before by her faith, whereby ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Proſelyte and an Iſraelite, in beleeving that the God of Iſrael <hi>was God in Heaven above and in earth beneath:</hi> was it not afterward continued by her worke in Receiving the Meſſengers? For was not that worke wrought by her faith? and at the ſacke of Jericho was not ſhe and her family preſerved by that worke, and thereby continued Proſelites unto Gods People? Now from theſe Examples and Similies of James, but eſpecially from his two reaſons, it evidently followes, that workes doe juſtifie in the ſenſe alleadged, namely conſervantly. For becauſe Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes is dead, and working with workes is by workes made perfect or effectuall; therefore workes doe preſerve and continue the life, perfection and efficacy of Faith; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they preſerve and continue the ſtate of Juſtification, which is the effect of faith; and whatſoever doth preſerve and continue Juſtification, that doth Juſtifie.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Yet not ex&EOLhyphen;cluding God{/NOTE -->True it is, that Neither faith nor works are the principall and prime efficients of my Juſtifying; becauſe God is the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, principall, and prime efficient, who makes mee to have my right, and who makes mee to hold it: but faith and workes are the reall, mediall, or meane efficients on my part. For God willeth and ordayneth that fayth ſhould bee my title whereby I acquire and have this right; and that workes ſhould be my tenure whereby to continue and hold it. From my title I whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclude my workes; allowing them neyther efficiency to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, nor preſence in my perſon at my Juſtifying. For faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without any efficiency or any preſence of workes within mee, doth make me to have this right. Becauſe when I am to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62812:125"/>
bee juſtified, I have not within me any workes at all, that any way qualifie me, or can bee truely ſayd to be reſident in mee. For manifeſt it is, that I am then in the ſtate and condition of a ſinner; if not legally of a tranſgreſſor againſt the Law, yet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of one ſomewhat improbous, who was many wayes pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in the rules of morality; equity, decency, and mercy; and jurally of one calamitous, who muſt ſuffer and die like a ſinner; for the proper ſubject of Juſtification is a ſinner.</p>
                     <p>But from my Tenure I exclude not faith,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}nor Faith.{/NOTE --> but include and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, adding and adjoyning my workes unto it. Becauſe in my Juſtification faith hath a double efficiency; firſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant to conſtitute it, and ſecondly a conſervant to continue it. Yet that degree of conſervancy which flowes from faith, is ſo imperfect, that unleſſe it be perfected by the acceſſe of works, fayth alone is not able to conſerve it ſelfe; for without workes ſhee is dead. Yet from my Tenure I exclude the ſolitarineſſe both of my faith and of my workes; for neither faith alone without workes, nor workes alone without faith; but both concurring and joyned together; <hi>viz.</hi> faith conducting and co-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating with workes, and workes accompanying and ſeconding faith doe juſtifie me conſervantly as my Tenure, making mee to continue and hold that ſtate of divine alliance which faith alone did create and conſtitute. And heerein I give the preeminence to faith; for I ſay not thus, <hi>Workes with faith,</hi> but thus, <hi>Faith with workes</hi> doth make up my Tenure; faith as the principall, and workes as acceſſories thereto, to animate, enable, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der faith effectuall unto that effect, which alone without workes it can not performe. Becauſe <hi>faith without workes</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and dead, but working with workes is by workes made perfect and effectuall.</p>
                     <p>And true it is, that Workes doe alſo juſtifie declaratively;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Works not only declare ju&s;tification,{/NOTE --> becauſe they declare, manifeſt, and ſhew that faith which doeth juſtifie efficiently; and which alone without workes is efficient procreantly; and which being alone without workes can not be declared. For words will not ſerve the turne to declare the exiſtence of faith, but this ſervice muſt be done by works. And therefore the exiſtence of that faith which is ſolitary, alone, and without workes, can by no meanes bee ſufficiently declared. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, Jam. 2.18. <hi>Shew mee thy faith without thy workes.</hi> Shew me, if thou canſt, (or thou canſt not ſhew mee) that faith of thine which is without workes, or which is ſolitary or alone by it ſelfe; for by thy words, in ſaying thou haſt faith, it is not ſufficiently ſhewed; and by thy workes it cannot poſſibly be ſhewed, becauſe (as thou acknowledgeſt) it is a ſolitary faith,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62812:126"/>
which is alone by it ſelfe deſtitute of workes. <hi>And I will ſhew thee my faith by my workes. i. e.</hi> But I will ſhew thee my operary faith which worketh with workes; for I will and doe declare it by my workes, becauſe I acknowledge that my faith is ſeconded and accompanied with workes.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}but Con&EOLhyphen;&s;erve it effi&EOLhyphen;ciently.{/NOTE -->Now becauſe faith is declared or ſhewed by workes, therfore workes are a Signe of faith; and conſequently they are a Signe of Juſtification to declare and ſhew the ſtate of it: becauſe faith is a cauſe whereof Juſtification is the effect, and whatſoever is a Signe of the cauſe, is alſo a Signe of the effect. Yet this is not all, and the whole influence, which workes have unto Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are a Signe of faith to declare it. But moreover, workes are a cauſe of faith to effect it; yet not a cauſe procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to conſtitute and produce it, but a cauſe conſervant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and maintaine it. For Jam. 2.26. <hi>As the body without the ſpirit is dead, ſo faith without workes is dead alſo.</hi> Now the Spirit whereby the body reſpireth and breatheth is a cauſe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet not a cauſe procreant to give the body life and being, but a cauſe conſervant to continue and maintaine the life and being of it.

                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Why faith is pre&s;&s;ed by Paul?{/NOTE -->For ſeeing that unto many words I willingly allow ſeverall ſenſes, not only modall but reall, I cannot with equity deny the like courteſie unto the Verbe <hi>Juſtified,</hi> for the honour of thoſe two great Apoſtles, Paul and James, who were planters of the Goſpel and pillars of the Church: eſpecially when I conſider the ſeverall parties with whom they had to deale. For Paul by his aſſertion oppoſeth the Judaizers (who as was formerly ſhewed upon the 14. verſe of this Chapter) were Operaries and Rituaries, ſtanding ſo much for the workes and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law, that they made workes the ſole and whole effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of Juſtification; both the cauſe conſervant to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and maintaine the ſtate of it, and alſo the cauſe procreant to conſtitute and produce the being of it. And therefore againſt the Infirmity of theſe, Paul in his Epiſtles to the Romans, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians and elſewhere, ſtoutly maintaines this doctrine, that <hi>A man is not juſtified by the workes of the Law, but by faith only.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in according to the quickneſſe and ſhortneſſe of his ſpeech, hee intends theſe two points. 1. That no workes at all are the cauſe procreant to conſtitute and build mans Juſtification, as was largely explicated, verſe 16.2. That no workes of the Law are a cauſe conſervant to continue and maintaine mans
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62812:126"/>
Juſtification, as ſhall bee diſcovered in the next verity. For in theſe two points the Judaizers held the contrary, as it plainly appeares, partly by their practiſe, and partly by his arguments againſt them.</p>
                     <p>But James in his aſſertion oppoſeth the Gentilizers,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and why workes by James?{/NOTE --> who were a party quite contrary to the former, and in oppoſition of them were Fiduciaries and Libertines, ſtanding onely for fayth and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, neglecting, deſpiſing, and diſgracing all maner of works, as no cauſe at all of Juſtification, neyther procreant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute or build the ſtate of it, nor conſervant to continue and maintayne it; as before was intimated after the 14. verſe.

Allowing therfore unto the word <hi>Justified,</hi> being a Verbe efficient or factive, theſe two ſenſes,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Both ea&s;ily reconciled;{/NOTE --> of efficiency procreant and conſervant; and thereupon affirming, that <hi>Faith only without workes doth juſtifie procreantly to conſtitute the ſtate of Juſtification: But faith with workes and by workes doth juſtifie conſervantly to continue that ſtate.</hi> Then it will plainly appeare concerning Paul and James, that neyther of their doctrines is a paradoxe, that neyther is to other repugnant; but each with the other is conſiſtent, and both are conducent to the verity and ſanctity of Chriſtianity. Nay more, the doctrine of James is to that of Paul a neceſſary conſequent, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing from Paul thoſe principles whereby it is both rayſed and proved.</p>
                     <p>For becauſe, as Paul teacheth,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}For both teach con&s;e&EOLhyphen;quently,{/NOTE --> my faith only without works doth procreate or build my Juſtification; and becauſe evill workes deſtroy the ſtate of it, and build againe my ſtate of ſinne, therefore it muſt needs follow, as Saint James teacheth, that good workes doe continue and maintaine the ſtate of it. For although they doe not procreate or build that ſtate, yet they preſerve and uphold it, from that deſtruction and ruine, which evill works would bring upon it. Againe, becauſe, as Paul teacheth, my continuance in ſin is the cauſe corrumpent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruent to decay &amp; deſtroy my Juſtification, which is to unjuſtifie me; therefore, as James teacheth, my continuance in good workes is the cauſe conſervant and reſtituent to preſerve the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62812:127"/>
ſtate and to reſtore the decayes of it. For in caſe I ſhould fall, my faith alone cannot reſtore mee: but if I recover, my faith working by workes of Repentance, muſt be the meanes of my Recovery. Beſides, becauſe, as Paul teacheth, 1. Cor. 13.2. <hi>Though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountaines, and have no charity, I am nothing:</hi> Therefore as James teacheth, <hi>faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes is dead:</hi> becauſe the acts of charity are good workes, and of all other the greateſt. Laſtly, becauſe as Paul teacheth, Gal. 5.6. <hi>In Christ Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by love:</hi> Therefore as James teacheth, <hi>Faith working with workes, is by workes made perfect,</hi> that it may finally availe in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and both temperately.{/NOTE -->Thus James in his doctrine and in his reaſons thereof ſecondeth Paul, not differing from him in ſenſe and truth, but onely in words and tearmes; and for that verball difference there was a juſt occaſion. For Paul being an Apoſtle to the Gentiles, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his doctrine with ſuch words and tearmes, that hee might give no offence, either to the unbelieving Gentiles, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon would continue in their unbeliefe: or to the believing Gentiles, who thereupon might recede from their beliefe. For hee made it his rule, not to offend any party, but to pleaſe all, ſeeking to ſave as many as hee could, labouring to plant the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and to increaſe the Church of God as much as might bee. And James being an Apoſtle to the Jewes, and writing to the twelve diſperſed Tribes, doth correſpondently carry himſelfe with the like temper, that hee likewiſe might give no offence, either to the unbelieving Jew or to the believing Judaizer.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}by the rule of Charity.{/NOTE -->Yet let no Chriſtian preſume to cenſure this temperate carriage with temporizing; ſeeing heerein theſe two great Apoſtles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized the great rule of Charity, which is, To walke without ſcandall or giving of offence; eſpecially to parties oppoſite, but rather to pleaſe both.

The Moralities of the Law therefore I doe and muſt obſerve: yet I obſerve them not in duty to the Law, becauſe ſhe commands them: nor for feare of the Law, becauſe ſhe threatens the breach of them. For I am not under the Law, but am dead to the Law; and it is a part of my Juſtification to bee free from the Law.</p>

Was not his love ſuper-legall above and beyond the Law? For did any Law command, that a father ſhould ſacrifice his ſon? And was not his love ſuper-naturall, above and beyond the Law of nature, when his love to God with whom he had alliance only by faith, ſurpaſſed his love to his only ſon, with whom hee had alliance by nature, and in whoſe behalfe he had received the promiſes?

                        <hi>the event whereof exceeded humane knowledge.</hi> For that this kinde of limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made, it plainly appeares from hence; in that the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and the ſervices thereto belonging, Heb. 9.9. are called <hi>a figure for the time preſent:</hi> and the reſt of the Ceremonies in meats, drinkes, and waſhings, Heb. 9.10. <hi>were impoſed untill the time of Reformation.</hi> Now the period or event of that <hi>time preſent, and of the time of Reformation,</hi> was at the making of the Law, ſo uncertaine that it paſſed the reach of humane knowledge. And that uncertaine time which the duration of the Law was limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was the time of Chriſt, whoſe time was the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. For the Law of Moſes was but a way leading unto the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ended at Chriſt, Rom. 10.4. <hi>for Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to every one that beleeveth.</hi> And as the occaſion of the Law was for tranſgreſſions, ſo the duration of it was untill the comming of Chriſt, Gal. 3.19. <hi>The Law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions, till the ſeed ſhould come to whom the promiſe was made.</hi> It was a Schoolemaſter to initiate the Jew for a time, untill the comming of Chriſt, Gal. 3.24. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was our Schoolemaſter unto Chriſt.</hi> And it was a tutor or governour to over-rule the childhood or the Jew for a time, the fulneſſe whereof was fulfilled at the comming of Chriſt, Gal. 4.2. <hi>We when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world; but when the fulneſse of the time was come, God ſent forth his ſon made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeeme them that were under the Law.</hi> Becauſe then the duration of the Law was not limited to any time certaine, therefore it was perpetuall and everlaſting: and yet becauſe the duration of it was limited to a time uncertaine, therefore it was tranſitory, mutable, and ceaſable.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore during the current of that uncertaine time,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}But is now expired,{/NOTE --> the Law was all that while mortall, and at the expiration of that time, it expired and died, <hi>i. e.</hi> it was then of no force, but fruſtrate and voyd. For as the Obligation or Bond of the Law while it ſtandeth in force, is called the life of the Law; for hence it is ſayd, Rom. 7.1. <hi>The Law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth. i. e.</hi> as long as the Law is in force, ſo the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Law when the force of it is expired, is called the death of the Law; for hence againe it is ſayd, Rom. 7.6. <hi>But
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62812:131"/>
now we are delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held. i. e.</hi> The Law being ceaſed and dead. Wherefore to ſpeak accurately and properly the Law was not abrogated or repealed: but of it ſelfe it expired and ceaſed: becauſe <hi>the fulnes of her time was come;</hi> for that uncertaine terme, whereto her duration was limited, was by the comming of Chriſt certainly determined. Yet this Expiration or Death of the Law is expreſſed by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall other words; for it is called Aboliſhing; Epheſ. 2.15. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aboliſhed in his fleſh the enmity, even the law of commandements.</hi> And Cancelling or blotting out, Col. 2.14. <hi>Blotting out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of ordinances that was againſt us.</hi> And Diſanulling, Heb. 7.18. <hi>For verily there is a diſanulling of the commandement going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the weakneſſe and unprofitableneſſe thereof.</hi> And Antiquating or making old, Heb. 8.13. <hi>In that he ſayth a new Covenant, he hath</hi> (antiquated or) <hi>made the firſt old.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}how far,{/NOTE -->Thus all the Lawes of Moſes are as dead as the Lawes of Solon or Lycurgus. Yet the death of the Moralityes contained in the Decalogue or elſewhere diſperſed muſt be cautelouſly underſtood by diſtinguiſhing between the Conſtitution of a Law, whereby it firſt hath being, and the Declaration of a Law, whereby that being which it had before is made knowne. For according to this diſtinction we ſay of Judges, that they doe not make Law, by conſtituting it: but they onely declare Law, by manifeſting that to bee Law, which was conſtitute and made before. Much more may the Law-maker himſelfe, in caſe of ignorance or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion declare that to be his Law, which hee had conſtituted for Law before. Now the Moralities in the Decalogue had their Conſtitution at the beginning of the world, for they are Lawes of nature, which God made at the making of man, from whoſe creation they reſulted. But they had a declaration in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, wherein God wrote them and publiſhed them to the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites; that thereby they taking notice of them to bee his Lawes might not make their ignorance an excuſe for their tranſgreſſions; for ſome Lawes of nature are of themſelves obſcure, and thoſe that are knowne are not to all men equally manifeſt. And they had a new Declaration in the new Covenant; for thereby Hebr. 8.10. <hi>God hath put them into our mindes, and written them in our hearts;</hi> and leſt our owne mindes and hearts ſhould deceive us, hee hath ſufficiently manifeſted them by Chriſt and his Apoſtles through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the New Teſtament. The Moralityes then in the Law of Moſes are dead as to that declaration which they had there; for by vertue thereof they binde no man: but they are not dead in reſpect of two other bonds; whereof the one is their new decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the New Teſtament, by vertue whereof they binde all
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62812:131"/>
Chriſtians; and the other their firſt Conſtitution as Lawes of nature, by vertue whereof they binde all men whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why the Law is dead,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and why &s;o.{/NOTE --> and why it expired at the death of Chriſt; is becauſe the Goſpel publiſhed by Chriſt is the laſt Will and Teſtament of God, eſtabliſhed upon better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and better Precepts then were in the Law; and was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the death of Chriſt; and therefore the Law which was Gods former Will and Teſtament is thereby infringed and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. For of Perſons teſtable the laſt and neweſt Will is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the beſt, and of ſuch validity or force, that at the very making of it, all former Wills are infringed; and at the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of it, all former are fruſtrated. And Chriſt who was the Executor of Gods laſt Will, did diſanull the firſt, to eſtabliſh the laſt, Heb. 10.9. <hi>Then ſayd he, Loe I come to doe thy Will, O God: He taketh away the firſt that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond.</hi> And Chriſt at his death by one and the ſame act effected both theſe things; for by his ſuffering on the Croſſe hee confirmed the New Will and Teſtament; for hence his bloud is called the bloud of the New Teſtament, and the Wine at the Communion is the memoriall of that Bloud, Mat. 26.27. <hi>And hee tooke the cup and gave thankes, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drinke ye all of it; for this is the bloud of the New Teſtament.</hi> And by the ſame ſuffering hee cancelled the firſt Will and Teſtament, Col. 2.14. <hi>Blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances which was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and tooke it out of the way, nayling it to his Croſſe.</hi> Yet hee cancelled the firſt Will but onely Conſequently <hi>i. e.</hi> upon his confirmation of the laſt Will, it followed neceſſarily that thereby the firſt was cancelled and fruſtrated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Am dead to the Law.]</hi> In reſpect of the Law,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and to what effect,{/NOTE --> I am putatively or as it were a dead perſon, who am no way acted or moved at any thing in the Law; not at her Promiſes, nor her Judgements, nor her Precepts in any kind, whether for matter of Policy, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or Morality. For I regard neither what ſhe promiſeth, nor what ſhe threatneth: not what ſhe commands, nor what ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids. And theſe words of mine are not preſumptuous, nor any way opprobrious or reproachfull to the Law; becauſe the Law it ſelfe is the cauſe why I am thus dead unto the Law; namely, becauſe the Law it ſelfe is dead; for through her death to me, I to her am dead. Yet my Perſon is not dead, but my ſubjection to the Law is dead; for my ſubjection was correlative to her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and Relatives as they mutually give being one to another, ſo they mutually take away each others being; for when either of the Relatives faile, the whole Relation ceaſeth; the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

therefore of the Law being dead, doth make my ſubjection to dye with it. As by the death of the Husband the Wife alſo dyeth: Yet not in her perſon as ſhe is a woman, but in her rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ſhe is a wife; for ſhe ceaſeth to bee a wife, though ſtill ſhe remaine a woman. For by this compariſon the Apoſtle doth elegantly illuſtrate both the death of the Law, and the death of the Jew unto the Law, Rom. 7.2. <hi>For the woman which hath an husband, is bound by the Law to her husband, ſo long as hee liveth: But if the husband bee dead, ſhe is looſed from the Law of her husband, i. e.</hi> Shee ceaſeth to bee his wife. And from hence hee inferres this concluſion, verſ. 4. <hi>Wherefore my brethren yee alſo are become dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt.</hi>

                        <hi>That I might live unto God.]</hi> Theſe words are a tacit prevention of an objection that might bee made againſt his former words. For ſome man might ſay unto him, if the Law bee dead, and you dead to the Law, and free from the dominion of it, then you may freely ſinne without controule. Heereto his anſwer is; I am not dead to the Law for that purpoſe, that I might ſinne: But contrarily, I am dead to the law, that I might not ſinne, but might dye as well to ſinne as to the Law. For I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dead unto the Law, <hi>that I might live unto God;</hi> by framing all my actions according to his grations Will, his laſt Will and Teſtament; which is the Will that hee hath ſurro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the deceaſed Law of Moſes, that was his former Will, but is now infringed; and which is the Rule whereby I am now to walke, that my wayes may bee acceptable and pleaſing unto God. For to this very end the Old Law is dead, and I am dead to the Law, that I might become a new Creature to live a new life in the ſervice of God. To ſerve him, not carnally after the old way in the Old Teſtament; but ſpiritually after the new way declared in the New Teſtament, Rom. 7.6. <hi>But now wee are delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein wee were held, that wee ſhould ſerve in newneſſe of ſpirit, and not in the oldneſſe of the letter.</hi> A like expreſſion to the words in hand wee have Rom. 6 11. <hi>Likewiſe reckon yee your ſelves to bee dead indeed unto ſinne, but alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And another after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Rom. 6.13. <hi>Neither yield yee your members as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſſe unto ſinne; but yield your ſelves unto God, as thoſe that are alive from the dead, and your members as inſtruments of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto God.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p> I <hi>Am Crucified.]</hi> The Croſſe was an inſtrument for criminall executions, whereon malefactors were put to death; a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much practiſed, and well knowne among the Romans, Greekes,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Chri&s;tian crucifying or mortifi&EOLhyphen;cation,{/NOTE --> and Jewes. And to bee Crucified was to bee nayled hand and foot upon the Croſſe, to ſuffer thereby a ſhamefull, paynfull, and lingring death. Hence by way of metaphor or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, the Faithfull when they renounce, reject, and croſſe the motions, deſires, and luſts of their carnall or fleſhly appetite, are ſayd in Scripture to crucifie, or mortifie the fleſh; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they themſelves are ſayd to bee crucified, or mortified. For when the Fleſh or carnall appetite, which is a kinde of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, is ſo curbed and croſſed, that ſhe cannot enjoy her former liberty and uſuall motions unto ſinne; then ſhe reſembles a man crucified, or nayled to the croſſe, who thereby loſeth, firſt his motion, and at laſt his life. The Apoſtle therefore would ſay; My death unto the Law, doth ſo far remove mee from living in ſin, that I am dead to ſin alſo: becauſe I am as it were crucified. For as a man that is crucified or nailed to the croſſe, doth dye a violent and paynfull death: ſo my old man, or that man that I was formerly, is ſo bruiſed and croſſed, that it is dead; not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and eaſie, but a violent and paynfull death. For the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of my former ſelfe, by croſſing the motions, deſires, and luſts of the fleſh, is unto my ſenſuall appetite not onely a ſimple death, but a death with violence and torment: becauſe when my appetite is croſſed, ſhe accounts her ſelfe vexed and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

                        <hi>With Chriſt.]</hi> Not really and locally, but putatively and quaſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for I am mortified, in a maner as hee was crucified; and ſo I am for two reaſons. 1. Becauſe his Crucifying is the Paterne, reſemblance, or likeneſſe of mine. For as Chriſt was crucified and dyed to his mortall life, that he might riſe to a new life, and live unto God: ſo I am mortified and dead unto ſin, that I might turne to a new life, and live unto God as a new creature. And as Chriſt was crucified but once, dying no more but once; for death had dominion over him no more but once: ſo I am mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and dead to ſinne once for all; and ſinne ſhall never have dominion over mee more: becauſe I will never againe returne
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62812:133"/>
under the bondage of it. For according to theſe reſemblances the Apoſtle propoſeth Chriſt unto every Chriſtian, as the true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of mortification; Rom. 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſinne might be deſtroyed, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we ſhould not ſerve ſinne: for he that is dead is freed from ſinne.</hi> And againe at the next verſe following but one, the other reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance followeth, <hi>Knowing that Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he dyed, he dyed unto ſinne once: but in that hee liveth, hee liveth unto God.

For ſeeing Chriſt by his death upon the Croſſe did confirme and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the laſt Will and Teſtament of God, to the Legacyes and Promiſes whereof I by fayth am juſtified, to have the ſame right in God with Chriſt or as Chriſt hath; namely a right of alliance and inheritance to be the ſon and heyre of God, as Chriſt is the ſon and heyre of God; and conſequently to be the brother of Chriſt, and a co-heyre with him to eternall bleſſednes. Are not theſe benefits by the death of Chriſt a cauſe, ground, and bond ſufficient to engage and oblige mee to crucifie or mortifie my ſin? Shall I partake in the alliance and inheritance of Chriſt, to bee a co-ally and a co-heire with him? and ſhall I not partake in his obedience, to be a ſufferer with him? eſpecially in this holy ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereby my ſin onely ſuffers death? For ſeeing Chriſt for my ſake layd downe his life; ſhall not I for his ſake lay downe my ſinne? Can I poſſibly doe leſſe for his ſake, who ſuffered ſo much for mine, then thus to conforme and plant my ſelfe into the likeneſſe of his death? And can I poſſibly doe more for my owne ſake; when by thus conforming and <hi>planting my ſelfe into the likenes of his death</hi> (Rom. 6.5.) <hi>I ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his reſurrection?</hi> If Chriſt dyed for mee, then muſt I dye to ſinne: becauſe his death bindes mee to it; 2 Cor. 5.14. <hi>For if one dyed for all, then were all dead. i. e.</hi> then were all to dye, or then all ought or muſt dye to ſin; for in this place, as in divers others, the action paſt is put for the duty to come. If Chriſt have any right in me, I muſt bee thus dead; Rom. 8.10. <hi>And if Chriſt bee in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſinne. i. e.</hi> the fleſh or ſenſuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is mortified or dead, that thereby ye may avoyd ſinn: as

And laſtly, if I have any right in Chriſt, I muſt be thus Crucified with Chriſt; Gal. 5.24. <hi>And they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts. i. e.</hi> have vowed and are bound to crucifie the fleſh, and muſt performe it; for heere againe the action is put for the duty.</p>

                     <p n="1"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Of &s;elf-love,{/NOTE -->1. The firſt worke of my love is to love my ſelfe. For the objects upon whom my love is exerciſed are God, my neighbour and my ſelfe: but becauſe the acts or workes of my love toward theſe three objects, muſt not bee practiſed in a diſorderly way,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62812:134"/>
but in a right and due courſe, therefore they muſt commence and begin at my ſelfe. Yet by my ſelfe-love,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the Nature of it,{/NOTE --> I meane not my Luſt, which is a ſenſuall deſire of the fleſh to have worldly good, as pleaſure, profit, and credit; for my Luſt is an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, improbous; and malignant motion of my fleſh or ſenſuall appetite condemned in the holy Scriptures; and therefore is that man in me that muſt be mortified, and that ſinne that muſt bee put to death, or whereto I muſt die. But by my ſelfe-love I meane that effect of my faith, which is a rationall affection of my will, doing ſervice to the ſpirit, and moving ſo contrary to my luſt, that by meanes of my Love, my luſt muſt bee mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for my ſelfe-love is my Will to doe, and alſo my doing of that good, which is decent, honeſt and holy, and for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof the ſpirit ſanctifies mee, as the ſeeking of mine owne ſalvation, my neighbours edification, and Gods glory; which laſt is the firſt in my intention, though it come the laſt in execution.</p>
                     <p>For if I conceive it a thing poſſible for mee,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the Nece&s;&s;i&EOLhyphen;ty of it,{/NOTE --> truly to love ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God or my neighbour, before I have truely loved my ſelfe, I greatly deceive mine owne ſoule. Becauſe my Love to my ſelfe is the ſtanderd, canon, or rule of that love, which I owe to my neighbour: for the law of Love commands mee to <hi>Love my neighbour as my ſelfe. i. e.</hi> As I love my ſelfe, ſo muſt I love my neighbour: if therefore I doe not really and truly love my ſelfe, how and whereby ſhould I proportion, regulate or meaſure out any true love unto my neighbour. And becauſe my Love to my ſelfe is alſo the ſtanderd, canon, or rule of that love which I owe to God; for the law of Love commands me, to <hi>Love the Lord my God with all my heart, with all my ſoule, and with all my mind. i. e.</hi> Really and truely, to the utmoſt of my power; not barely as I love my ſelfe, but much more and in a greater meaſure. If therefore in my heart, ſoule and minde, I have no true love at all, how can I love God with all that love which is in my heart, ſoule and mind? or when I have no meaſure of love to my ſelfe, how can I be ſayd to love God, in a greater meaſure then I love my ſelfe?</p>
                     <p>True it is, that my love to God is the firſt Commandement,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the Facility,{/NOTE --> <hi>i. e.</hi> the firſt for dignity; but the firſt for practiſe is love to my ſelfe; and therefore my love muſt begin at my ſelfe, that thence proceeding to my neighbour, it may determine in God, who is the chiefeſt, higheſt, and finall object of it; That rebounding backe againe from him, it may for his ſake bee increaſed upon my neighbour, and for my neighbours ſake upon my ſelfe. And my love to God is the greateſt Commandement, <hi>i. e.</hi> the greateſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62812:135"/>
for performance: but the leaſt for performance is love to my ſelfe; and therefore againe my love muſt begin at my ſelfe: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am to begin at things leaſt and moſt eaſie; for if I can not truely love my ſelfe, which is the leaſt and eaſieſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, how ſhall I love my brother which is greater and harder, and conſequently how God, which is the greateſt and hardeſt taske of love? For ſeeing God is inviſible, whom I ſee not, and my brother is viſible whom I ſee, it muſt needes bee a matter of greater difficulty to love God, then to love my brother; for, 1. John 4.20. <hi>Hee that loveth not his brother whom hee hath ſeene, how can hee love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and want of it:{/NOTE -->Doth it not from hence plainely appeare, that hee is but an hypocrite, who profeſſeth to love God, and yet loveth not his brother? for too manifeſt it is, that many Chriſtians who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the love of Chriſt, are ſo farre from brotherly love, that they hate their brother for whom Chriſt dyed; and hate him more, then doe many Jewes who profeſſe themſelves enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. And my ſoule bleeds to conſider the bloody Warres that for many yeares have raged, and ſtill continue in moſt parts of Chriſtendome, wherein more Chriſtian blood hath been ſpilt by Chriſtians, then ever was ſhed by all the Heathen. Oh what a foule ſtaine is this to the profeſſion of Chriſt, that they for whoſe ſalvation Chriſt was crucified, ſhould dayly practiſe one anothers deſtruction? Amongſt many other cauſes, whereby Chriſtians fall into theſe Unchriſtian courſes, it ſeemes this is one, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the courſe and order of love, in beginning the practice of it upon God, in whom the practice ſhould determine. This is not the way of true zeale, but the errour of that which is blind.</p>
                     <p n="2"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the work of it,{/NOTE -->2. My firſt ſelfe-love is to mortifie my ſinnes. For my morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is a worke of true love to my ſelfe. Becauſe this worke is a killing or deading of that ferity or wildneſſe, which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is bred in my fleſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> in my ſenſuall appetite, by ſubduing, maſtering, and taming her motions and deſires, regulating and ordering them in ſuch manner, that about carnall pleaſure, they runne not into the ſinnes of uncleanneſſe, to pollute, defile, and ſurfeit my ſoule with gluttony, drunkeneſſe, and whoredome; that about worldly profit, tney fall not into the ſinne of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, to fill my heart with the thornes of worldly cares, and with the hookes of filthy lucre; that about worldly credit they riſe not into the ſinne of Pride, to ſwell my minde with the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and botches of humane praiſes and commendations. Is not this worke of mortification, a doing of my ſelfe great good, and therefore a worke of true love to my ſelfe? for if I beare not from my ſelfe ſo much love to my ſelfe as to fortifie, watch,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62812:135"/>
and ward my ſoule, againſt the invaſions and aſſaults of theſe ſinnes; I am a traitour to mine owne ſoule; for is not hee is treacherous villaine, that will ſuffer his City to be entred by that enemy, whom hee hath power to repell? If I have any love to my life and health, I am carefull to keepe my ſelfe from the Pox and the Plague; are the Pox and the Plague more dangerous to my body, then are drunkeneſſe and whoredome both to my body and ſoule? Or is a ſoule defiled with theſe ſinnes, leſſe filthy then a Leper, or leſſe ugly then a face all cruſted with the Pox.</p>
                     <p>And my mortification is the firſt worke of my love.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the Order of that worke,{/NOTE --> Becauſe untill this worke bee done, I can doe no workes of love at all. None to my ſelfe; for when I am a Drunkard, a Leacher, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and proud, how can I performe ſuch love to my ſelfe, as to furniſh and adorne my ſoule with the virtues of Sobriety, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, Liberality, and Humility? For by what meanes can theſe virtues enter, while their contrary vices keepe the poſſeſſion of of mee? None to my Brother; for when I am covetous and greedy after worldly gaine, to get what I can out of my brother; how can I performe the duties of Juſtice and Equity, to give my brother his right and his due in all things that are his, either by Law or Reaſon? Or when my Covetouſneſſe makes mee ſo ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly, that to thrive in the world by ſparing and ſaving, I ſcarce allow my Family meat and drinke fitting for it according to my condition; how then can I doe the offices of Mercy and Kindneſſe to my brother, in giving meat to the hungry, and drinke to the thirſty, in entertaining the ſtranger, cloathing the naked, and viſiting the ſick? Yet theſe are the workes of brotherly love, whereby I muſt bee tryed at the day of Judgement, and whereby the finall ſentence muſt paſſe upon me.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, untill this worke be done,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}the ne&s;&s;ity of it,{/NOTE --> I can doe no workes of love to God; my acts of piety and devotion in prayers, prayſes, and thankſgivings, for the worſhip and ſervice of God, cannot paſſe for workes of love. For when I am a Drinker or a Leacher, can I love God, and will God accept love from a loathſome ſoul, that ſtinketh of Drunkenneſſe and Leachery? When I am co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, can I love God, and will God accept love from an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous ſoule? for is not covetouſneſſe idolatry? and can I worſhip two ſuch contrary deities, as God and an idol? or can I ſerve two ſuch contrary maſters, as God and Mammon? When I am proud, can I love God, and will God accept love from a lofty ſoule, that is puffed up with vaine glory, preferring her owne prayſe before Gods glory? But ſome man may ſay, that God loved us then when we were ſinners, and ſo loved us that he gave his Sonne to die for us. To him I anſwer, that indeed
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:62812:136"/>
God did ſo: yet he loved us, not to this end that we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin; but to this, that wee ſhould not continue in it, but mortifie and put it to death, that being purged and cleanſed from it, we might thereby be prepared and fitted to love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with love beſeeming his acceptance.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and Neglect of it.{/NOTE -->Hence againe there appeares another hypocriſie, when I am carefull to mortifie the ſin of my brother, before I have killed mine owne. And the exerciſe of this hypocriſie in miſtaking the due order and practiſe of mortification hath beene one cauſe of the greateſt troubles in the Church of Chriſt. For as my practiſe of love muſt not begin at God but end in him, ſo my practiſe of mortification muſt not begin upon my brother, but muſt commence at my ſelfe and determine in him. That having <hi>firſt caſt out the beame out of mine owne eye, I may ſee cleerely to cast out the mote out of my brothers eye:</hi> that having firſt beaten down the beames of pride and covetouſneſſe which are inward ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignities in my ſelfe, and the rootes of all evill unto others, I may mortifie the moates of ſwearing and drunkenneſſe which are the outward infirmities of my brother. For if mine owne beame move me to mortifie my brothers moate, I quicken a greater ſinne in my ſelfe, to kill a leſſe in him. Very fitting it is for the advance of Gods glory, that my brothers idolatry ſhould be mortified: but when my covetouſneſſe moves me to mortifie it, that I may devoure his eſtate, I kill an idolatry in him to quicken a greater in my ſelfe. For of all idolatry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe is the greateſt: becauſe it is an idolatry altogether prophane, without any colour or ſhew of piety. Hence ſayth the Apoſtle, Rom. 2.22. <hi>Thou that abhorreſt idols, doeſt thou commit ſacrilege? i. e.</hi> Art thou ſo covetous, as to rob God? For all ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a worke of covetouſneſſe, and all robbing of God is a foul impiety.</p>

Although I am dead to the Law, not living by her rule; and am dead to ſin, not ſerving ſin, nor ſuffering ſin to rule over me, but have crucified or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified it.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:62812:136"/>
and quickned: Wherefore I am dead and aliue in reſpect of different faculties of my ſoule: becauſe the death of one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is the life of the other; for the death of my fleſh is the life of my ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>This kinde of death and life not only may,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Mortificatio&cmbAbbrStroke; is true life,{/NOTE --> but needs muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, comply, and ſtand together in me; for in effect and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this death and life are but one and the ſame thing, which under contrary names make up in mee that one and the ſame thing, which is ſanctity or holineſſe. For as in a journey, there ſeem two contrarieties, namely a departing from one place, and a travelling to another: yet really and in effect, both theſe are but one and the ſame journey; differing onely in tearmes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe from one place, and acceſſe to another, yet the motion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding betweene thoſe diſtant places is one and the ſame. Or as in curing the body of ſome diſeaſe, there ſeeme two contrary actions, namely an expelling of the diſeaſe, and an inducing of health: yet really, and in effect both theſe make but one and the ſame cure. So in my Repentance, regeneration, renovation, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or by what names ſoever the Scriptures call the cure of my ſoule, there ſeem two contrarietyes, namely my forſaking of ſin, or dying to it, and my approching to holineſſe or living to God: yet really and in effect, both theſe are but one and the ſame converſation or walking.</p>
                     <p>Hence it appeares that mortification and vivification are really but one and the ſame motion, making up in me that one and the ſame morall alteration, which is my ſanctification,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and really is Sanctificati&EOLhyphen;on,{/NOTE --> yet there is between them a rationall difference in 3 reſpects. 1. Of their order; for in order of nature or reaſon, though not of time or continuance, mortification is firſt; for that beginneth, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently vivification may follow. 2. Of their object, for the matter mortified is ſin; but that vivified is holines. 3. Of the ſubject; for the faculty mortified is the fleſh, but that vivified is the ſpirit. Yet the faculty of my fleſh is not mortified for the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it: but for ſome qualityes of it; for the faculty of the fleſh doth alſo live in mee as much as that of the ſpirit: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though unto ſome motions my fleſh bee deaded, yet unto ſome others it ſtill liveth, and conduceth to uſefull and lawfull effects in mee. For as in the killing of quick-ſilver, the ſilver remaines after the killing it, and ſerves for ſeverall uſes: but that malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ferity, or quicknes of the ſilver, which in the uſe thereof would prove noxious and hurtfull, is extinguiſhed, and deaded. So in the Mortifying of my fleſh, the faculty remaines after the mortifying and lives in me to divers good purpoſes: but that fiercenes, raſhnes and quicknes of my appetite, the luſts and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62812:137"/>

                        <hi>Who loved mee.]</hi> The Motive that induced Chriſt to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for mee; was his Love to mee.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Chri&s;ts love cau&s;ed his death;{/NOTE --> For as the fruit of his death was my good: So the roote of it was his love; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee loved mee; therefore hee dyed for mee.

And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely a liberall love; for ſeeing love delights to give, what could hee give mee more then <hi>to give himſelfe</hi> for mee? For the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his love unto mee is heere ſignified by two circumſtances that incloſe and ſtand about his Love. One before it, by the greatneſſe of his perſon, in that hee was the ſonne of God; for what greater perſon was there in the world, who was mortall and able to dye for mee? The other after it, by the greatneſſe of his paſſion in that hee <hi>gave himſelfe to death for mee;</hi> for what could hee poſſibly doe more for my ſake, then to lay downe his life for mee? Seeing beyond this, there can bee no greater love; and hence hee himſelfe commends the greatneſſe of love, John 15.13. <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay downe his life for his friends.</hi> His love therefore was the Cauſe of his death; and his death was the Effect of his love. For hence in ſeverall paſſages of Scripture, his Love and his Death go hand in hand, as the Cauſe with the effect; As Epheſ. 5.2. <hi>Walke in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and given himſelfe for us.</hi> And Epheſ. 5.25. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelfe for it.</hi> And 1. John 3.16. <hi>Heereby perceive wee the love of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee layd downe his life for us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet the love of Chriſt unto mee,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}not exclu&EOLhyphen;ding Gods love,{/NOTE --> was not the ſole and onely cauſe of his death for mee; ſo as to exclude the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from being concurrent with the love of Chriſt.

cauſe why Chriſt dyed for mee, and muſt needes bee alſo the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame cauſe, that hath no higher cauſe above it. For Chriſt therefore dyed for mee, becauſe hee loved mee, and hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loved mee, becauſe God loved mee: But why God loved mee, I know no cauſe, beſide his love. Yet that Gods love to mee is the cauſe why Chriſt dyed for mee, is manifeſt from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall paſſages of Scripture; as John 3.16. <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that hee gave his onely begotten Sonne, i. e.</hi> Gave him to dye; for his love to the World was the cauſe, why hee expoſed his ſonne to death. And Rom. 3.25. <hi>God hath ſet forth Christ, to bee a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſse, i. e.</hi> His kindnes, which is the effect of his love. And Rom. 5.8. <hi>But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> And 1.

                     </p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}which al&s;o cau&s;ed it,{/NOTE -->And the greatneſſe of Gods love heerein, is manifeſt alſo by two circumſtances. One of the Perſon dying; a perſon of that Majeſty, and of ſo neare alliance unto God, that hee was the ſonne of God, and his onely begotten ſonne. Which muſt needs argue in God an exceſſe and high degree of love. For hee that is ſo free, as to give up his owne ſonne for mee, doth thereby fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give mee to underſtand, that hee would willingly give mee all that ever hee hath. And beyond this, can there bee any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love, or can any love bee more free? Yet ſuch was Gods love to mee in the death of Chriſt, Rom. 8.32. <hi>Hee that ſpared not his owne ſonne, but delivered him up for us all; how ſhall hee not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> The other Circumſtance is of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for whom Chriſt dyed; for they were ſinners and ungodly wretches; perſons deſerving death themſelves, and altogether unworthy that any one ſhould dye for them, and therefore much leſſe the ſonne of God. Peradventure for good and godly men, ſome man would dye; but would any man dye for ſinners and ungodly wretches? But Chriſt dyed for us while wee were yet ſinners and ungodly; and therein God commended the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his love to us, Rom. 5.7. <hi>Peradventure for a good man, ſome would even dare to dye; but God commendeth his love towards us, in that while wee were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> Hence there will follow theſe three verities.</p>
                     <p n="1"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and not his Anger.{/NOTE -->1. <hi>Gods wrath was not the cauſe of Chriſts death.]</hi> For wee cannot finde any ſuch Doctrine delivered in the Scriptures: But from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall expreſſe Scriptures wee have clearely ſhewed, that the cauſe of Chriſts death was Gods love unto us; and that love was not ordinary and vulgar, but ſingularly and intirely the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, that ever was in the world. Wee were indeede the <hi>children

of wrath, i. e.</hi> lyable to Gods wrath, and worthy of it: Yet it doth not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thence follow that God was then actually wrath with us; for God who is rich in grace and mercy may (in a divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) actually love them, who actually deſerve his wrath. And when Chriſt dyed for us, wee were then <hi>dead in ſinnes, i. e.</hi> guilty of death by reaſon of our ſinnes: Yet it thence followeth not, that our ſinnes were puniſhed in the death of Chriſt; for God may actually pardon their life, who actually are guilty of death. This God may doe <hi>de jure,</hi> and hath already done it <hi>de facto;</hi> and hee hath done it for this end, that thereby hee might ſhew the exceeding riches of his love and grace, in his mercy and kindneſſe towards us through Chriſt; Epheſ. 2.3. <hi>Wee all had our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in times paſt in the luſts of our fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the minde, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith hee loved us, even when wee were dead in ſinnes, hath quickned us together with Chriſt (by grace yee are ſaved) and hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus; that in the Ages to come, hee might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſſe towards us through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Certainely ſuch love as heere is mentioned, ſo exceeding rich in grace, mercy, and kindneſſe, muſt needes bee free from wrath and anger; unleſſe wee are content to ſay, that at one and the ſame time in reſpect of the ſame acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of the ſame perſons, God was exceeding loving, and yet exceeding angry; which at laſt will come to this, that at the ſame time the ſame God loved and loved not.</p>

For the Apoſtle according to his former perſonation, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his argument in his owne perſon; concluding his Negative from an abſurdity which muſt neceſſarily follow upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Affirmative of it. For if I am juſtified by the workes of the Law; then it muſt needs follow, that thereby I doe fruſtrate or made voyd the grace of God: becauſe the Law of God and the Grace of God make ſuch oppoſite titles, that if I claime by his Law, I muſt needs diſclaime his Grace. The Neceſſity of this conſequence he further declares and confirmes by inſtancing in the gracious Meanes, whereby this divine Right of Inheritance to Bleſſednes is conveyed and ſetled upon me; namely by the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death of Chriſt upon the Croſſe, wherein God ſhewed the riches of his grace, when by the death of his owne Son he teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed that Will and Teſtament, wherein this Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was deviſed unto mee. For if my Right of Inheritance came by reaſon of the Law, then Chriſt who died to ſettle this Right upon me, dyed without any cauſe on Gods part, and there was no ſufficient reaſon why his Father who ſo dearly loved him, ſhould expoſe him unto death, much leſſe unto ſuch a bitter death; if therefore I fruſtrate the death of Chriſt, I thereby alſo

fruſtrate the grace of God. And for this argument from Gods grace, hee ſeemes to take occaſion from the laſt words of the former verſe, wherein hee mentioned the love of Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all grace is love.</p>

And 1.

                     <p>And Gods grace wherby I am juſtified unto this Right,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Gods grace is rich.{/NOTE --> is rich grace. For that is a frequent attribute wherby the Scripture doth commend and magnifie the greatnes, plenty, and abundance of Gods grace, by ſtiling it the riches of his grace. As Rom. 11.12. <hi>Now if the fall of them be the richeſſe of the World,</hi>

And Epheſ. 1.7. <hi>In whom wee have redemption through his bloud, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded towards us.</hi> And Epheſ. 2.7. <hi>That in the ages to come, he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſſe towards us through Jeſus Chriſt. i. e.</hi> the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding plenty and abundance of his grace; for although grace and kindneſſe be really one and the ſame thing: yet after the word grace, the Apoſtle addeth the word kindneſſe; that by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his words, he might ſignifie the abundance of Gods grace. Certainely ſin aboundeth in the world, and hath done ſo in all ages; yet grace doth over-abound it; Rom. 3.20. <hi>The Law entred that the offence might abound: but where ſinne abounded, grace did much more abound. i. e.</hi> After the Law was given, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent was, that ſin abounded: and after ſin had abounded, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent was, that grace did ſuper-abound, by over-reigning, over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and overcomming ſin: becauſe God by his grace doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgive eternall death which is the puniſhment of ſin: but over and above he doth give us a right unto eternall life, by juſtifying us thereunto through Chriſt; as it there followeth in the next verſe; <hi>That as ſinne hath reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reigne through righteouſneſſe</hi> (through a Right) <hi>unto eternall life.</hi>
                        <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and Rea&s;ons 3.{/NOTE --> And this richneſſe or greatneſſe of Gods grace appeares from three grounds.</p>
                     <p n="1"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}1 It is with&EOLhyphen;out cau&s;e.{/NOTE -->1. Becauſe Gods grace is without a cauſe. There was no cauſe moving God to juſtifie me; for as we ſayd before, his grace is hereof the ſupreame or prime cauſe, having no other cauſe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62812:149"/>
above or beyond it to actuate or move it. What moved God to bee ſo gracious unto mee, as to predeſtinate or deviſe unto mee in his laſt Will and Teſtament, this divine ſtate of alliance and inheritance with him? Certainely, no Merit or deſert of mine moved him;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Not from Merit,{/NOTE --> for it was not for any worke or other act of mine, which I had done, or which God foreſaw I would doe, that could deſerve this grace. Becauſe Gods grace and my workes are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of cauſality ſo inconſiſtent and contrary, that they cannot both concurre as cauſes procreant of the ſame bleſſing: But the claime by one, doth neceſſarily exclude the other. For if it bee by workes, it is of debt, and then it cannot bee of grace, Rom. 4.4. <hi>Now to him that worketh, is the reward reckoned, not of grace, but of debt.</hi> But if it bee by grace, it is of gift, and then it cannot bee of workes, Rom. 11.6. <hi>And if by grace, then it is no more of workes, otherwiſe grace is no more grace.</hi>
                        <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}nor Reque&s;t,{/NOTE --> No Petition or Requeſt of mine moved him; for I never made any motion or ſuit for it; neither was it my counſell or advice, that God ſhould deviſe this Legacy unto mee; for Rom. 11.34. <hi>Who hath knowne the minde of the Lord, or who hath beene his counſellour?</hi> Neither had I any exiſtence when Gods Will was framed.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}nor Inquiry,{/NOTE --> Laſtly, no inquiry or ſeeking of mine moved him heereto; for I never asked after it, nor deſired it, and I had no deſire to it, becauſe I had no knowledge of it; hence ſaith God in reſpect of his grace, Rom. 10.20. <hi>I was found of them that ſought mee not, I was made manifeſt unto them that asked not after mee.</hi> And when by the preaching of the Goſpel, God ſought mee, asked after mee, and called mee to accept his grace, I was hardly perſwaded to believe and receive it. And unto this day many Nations cannot bee perſwaded of it; yea ſome Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians are not rightly and fully perſwaded of it.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}But from Gods proper motion,{/NOTE -->But God was heereto moved of his owne meere and proper motion, wherein the will of his grace was the prime cauſe or firſt mover. For according to the good pleaſure, purpoſe, and counſell of his owne Will, hee predeſtinated or deviſed this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy unto mee,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}According to his owne will,{/NOTE --> Epheſ. 1.11. <hi>In whom wee have obtained an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him, who worketh all things after the counſell of his owne Will.</hi> For in all Teſtaments, what other cauſe is there of the Legacies therein deviſed, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the will and purpoſe of the Teſtator; whoſe Teſtament is in that reſpect called his Will? But if the Legacies proceed from the Will of the Legataries,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}which o&EOLhyphen;therwi&s;e were not his but ours.{/NOTE --> then to ſpeake properly, the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is their Will, and not the Will of the Teſtator. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though among men it may fall out, that the Teſtator may bee moved to ſome Legacy by the Petition of the Legatary, or by the interceſſion of ſome friend: Yet with God it cannot bee thus;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62812:149"/>
becauſe his Will was made from the foundation of the World, before the exiſtence of any perſon intereſſed who could ſollicite or move him thereupon. Now that Grace which hath no cauſe moving it, but moves of its owne free accord, is farre more rich and gracious then that grace which hath a cauſe, which is ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and moved by the importunities and petitions of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For as an Injury done without cauſe is the more malicious, ſo a kindneſſe without cauſe is the more gracious; whereas grace begged is but beggerly grace.</p>

Cor. 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things that God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi>

Certainly the Inhabitants of ſuch a City muſt needs be, not only rich, but very glorious; and therefore Gods grace in tranſlating mee from the grave, which is the den of death and rottenneſſe, to ſeat mee in heaven, which is the manſion of joy and bleſſednes, muſt needs be very gracious.</p>

Hence we are ſayd to be Gods Purchaſe, which he bought at a price, 1. Cor. 6.20. <hi>Ye are not your owne, for ye are bought with a price.</hi> And for the purchaſe of us, hee payd very deare; for the price wherewith wee were bought, was the price of bloud, Epheſ. 1.7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his bloud.</hi> And the bloud of our redemption was precious bloud,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}&amp; precious.{/NOTE --> 1. Pet. 18.19. <hi>Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vaine converſation received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious bloud of Christ.</hi> For the bloud of Chriſt muſt needs bee precious, becauſe it was the bloud of God. Act. 20.28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves — to feede the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his owne bloud.</hi> And the cauſe why God expended that bloud, was his meere grace according to the richeſſe and abundance of it; Epheſ. 1.7. <hi>In whom wee have redemption through his bloud, the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, according to the riches of his grace, wherein hee hath abounded towards us.</hi> Now that grace which is ſo chargeable to the donour, that it coſteth bloud, muſt needs be rich and coſtly.</p>

But an Inheritance is one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall kind, and indeed the beſt kind of Right, when it comes to be in poſſeſſion: becauſe it is an univerſall and perpetuall Right extended to a whole eſtate for ever.

Secondly, both theſe ſayings carry the ſame reaſon: becauſe in both places hee argues for one and the ſame conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; namely that a man is not juſtified by the Law; which hee proves from the ſeverall abſurdities, which upon a ſuppoſall of the affirmative will neceſſarily follow; for if a man be juſtified by the Law, or if his right come by the Law; or if his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be of the Law, (for all theſe ſayings are all one in effect)

To Con&EOLhyphen;firme it,{/NOTE -->2. <hi>To eſtabliſh or confirme the force of the New Teſtament.</hi>] Every Teſtament doth neceſſarily require a ſolemne Confirmation of it, that may cauſe it to be of ſtrength and in force: becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or making of a Teſtament is in it ſelfe an imperfect and infirme act, untill it be ratified and eſtabliſhed by a further act of Confirmation,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}which al&s;o was nece&s;&s;a&EOLhyphen;ry,{/NOTE --> whereby all power to revoke it is extinguiſhed in the Teſtator, and whereby the Teſtament comes to be of force.

Becauſe every Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament according to the definition and nature of it, is a Decree touching things to be done after death. For the Teſtator in the time of his life doth predeſtinate, ordaine, and deviſe in his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament thoſe things which he would have take effect after his death, and which before his death are of no force. Hence ſayth the Apoſtle, Heb. 9.16. <hi>Where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be the death of the Teſtator; for a Teſtament is of force after men are dead: otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all, whilſt the Teſtator li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi>

                     <p>The New Teſtament then was confirmed:<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}&amp; Effected:{/NOTE --> becauſe God would have the world take notice, that he had not onely no will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it, but alſo had left himſelfe no power to revoke it. And it was confirmed by death: becauſe God would further have all men to underſtand, that upon the death of the Confirmer, the Teſtament was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> in force, and began to take effect. But God who is the Teſtator could not confirme his Teſtament by his owne death in his owne proper perſon:<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Yet not by the Te&s;tator in his owne per&s;on:{/NOTE --> becauſe though he be a Perſon Teſtable who can make a Teſtament, yet withall he is a perſon immortall, who cannot dye: and therefore the moſt High God hath this prerogative, that he may confirme his Teſtament by the death of another.

And after his death, hee taught them the Neceſſity of his death, that <hi>it behoved</hi> him to die and riſe again from the dead, that thereupon the Goſpel might be preached in his name, Luk. 24.46. <hi>And hee ſayd unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhould bee preached in his name among all Nations, beginning at Jeruſalem.</hi> Thus the immediate, proper, finall cauſes or reaſons why Chriſt dyed, are chiefely three; namely, to Teſtifie the truth of the New Teſtament; to Confirme the force of it, and to Execute the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of it; for unto a Teſtament once conſtituted, what acts more do neceſſarily belong then the Teſtification, the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Execution of it?</p>
                     <p>But the remote cauſes of his death might bee many and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}whereof the cau&s;es re&EOLhyphen;mote were many,{/NOTE --> For all the actions done by Chriſt as Mediatour of the New Teſtament, were cauſes of his death; whether wee reſpect his Prophetick Office in publiſhing Gods Will, preaching his Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and working Miracles; or his Prieſtly Office, in ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Believers, and expiating their ſinnes; or his Kingly Office, in governing his people, and ſubduing their enemies. And all benefits redounding to Believers, as the Legacies and Promiſes of the New Teſtament, were cauſes of his death; as their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Remiſſion of their ſinnes, their Reſurrection and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And all Duties to bee done by Believers, as the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without which they are not to enjoy their Legacies, are the cauſes of his death; as their ſanctity or holyneſſe;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}yet all &s;ub&EOLhyphen;ordinate to the three forementio&EOLhyphen;ned:{/NOTE --> their dying to ſinne, and newneſſe of life in all the good workes of love. But all theſe and the like are not oppoſite or repugnant to the three cauſes by us aſſigned; but are comprehended and included in
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62812:159"/>
them, are ſubordinate and conſequent to them, are collected and inferred from them. For becauſe Chriſt dyed to teſtifie, confirm, and execute the New Teſtament, and my ſanctity or holineſſe is a Precept thereof, and a duty by me to be done; therefore Chriſt dyed for my Sanctification that I might dye unto ſin, and live unto holineſſe; and conſequently he dyed for my patience, temperance, mercifulneſſe, &amp;c. becauſe theſe and the like are branches of holineſſe. And becauſe Chriſt dyed to teſtifie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and execute the New Teſtament, wherein Remiſſion of ſins, the Reſurrection from the dead, and Glorification were deviſed and promiſed as Legacies unto Believers; therfore Chriſt alſo dyed for the Remiſſion of my ſins, for my Reſurrection and Glorification.</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}But the Re&EOLhyphen;mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins is mo&s;t mentioned,{/NOTE -->Yet among the remote Cauſes of Chriſts death, the Scripture doth moſt frequently mention the Remiſſion of ſins. Because my ſins have the greateſt force upon me to bereave, or at leaſt to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me from the hope of their forgivenes. For according to the evidence of reaſon; if I looke upon my ſins to conſider the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and fouleneſſe of them, how can I chuſe but feare, that I have deſerved a fearfull puniſhment, and that God in his Juſtice will inflict it on me? Or if I looke upon my death to conſider my diſſolution and rottenneſſe in the Grave, how can I hope, that God whom I have ſo often and ſo much offended, ſhould ever reſtore me to life, and tranſlate me unto the Joyes of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and the Rea&EOLhyphen;&s;on.{/NOTE --> The Scripture therefore is very frequent in preſſing the point for the Remiſſion of my ſins: becauſe my gracious heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father would have me to conceive and embrace a firme, ſure, and ſtedfaſt hope of their future forgivenes; that by virtue of that hope I might utterly forſake them, and ſeriouſly devoting my life to holineſſe, I might cherefully walke on in the way to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe. Unto the Remiſſion of my ſins I have in this life a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent right: but the poſſeſſion and benefit of this right is ſo future, that I ſhall not enjoy it till the Reſurrection; and then all my ſins paſt unto this day ſhall be actually forgiven, upon my preſent forſaking of my ſins. For this futurity muſt exerciſe my hope, and my hope of their future forgiveneſſe muſt engage me to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent forſaking of them. Thus it is evident that Chriſt dyed not without cauſe; ſeeing of his death there were three immediate cauſes,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The force of Pauls argu&EOLhyphen;ment.{/NOTE --> and divers other remote cauſes. Now let us conſider the Apoſtles Argument, and we ſhall perceive the force of it from theſe two points following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>In that theſe cauſes are repugnant to Juſtifying by the Law.]</hi> For betweene theſe cauſes of Chriſts death and that effect of the Law, the repugnancy ariſeth thus. It is the proper effect of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62812:159"/>
every teſtament to Iuſtifie;<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The effect of a Te&s;tament.{/NOTE --> for therein the teſtator doth give a preſent right to the future poſſeſſion of gifts, Legacies, and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances, which he predeſtinateth, ordaineth, and deviſeth, unto thoſe perſons whom he loveth and favoureth. Hence it was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law of the twelve tables, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti quiſque legaſſit ſuae rei, ita jus eſto. i. e.</hi> as any man deviſeth his eſtate by his Will, ſo let the right paſſe; and hereto agree both the Law of Nations and of nature. That Teſtament therefore wherein no perſon is juſtified, is more inofficious then that, wherein perſons to be neceſſarily juſtified, are wholly preterited. It is therefore the effect of both Gods teſtaments, of the Old and the New, of the Law and the Goſpel, to juſtifie in their kind.</p>
                     <p>But theſe two Teſtaments are apparently different.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Gods two Te&s;taments are different,{/NOTE --> Becauſe they Juſtife differently; for they juſtifie different perſons; the Old juſtifying workers onely, but the New onely Believers; they juſtifie from different ſinnes, the Old onely from ignorances and infirmities, but the New from all ſinnes whatſoever: And they juſtifie unto different inheritances, the Old onely to terrene and temporal, but the New unto caeleſtiall and eternall; as was large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared before upon verſ. 16. Hence of the New Teſtament it is ſayd expreſly, Heb. 8.6. <hi>That it is a better Teſtament, which was eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes.</hi> But if betweene the Old and the New, there be no difference, it cannot be truly ſayd of the New, that it is a better Teſtament: becauſe of two things that have no difference, neither can be better then the other.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and there&EOLhyphen;fore are Re&EOLhyphen;pugnant.{/NOTE --> This difference then betweene theſe two Teſtaments breeds ſuch a repugnancy between them, that they cannot both ſubſiſt. For when one and the ſame teſtator maketh different teſtaments, then the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of either is repugnant to the ſubſiſtence and force of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Becauſe one and the ſame perſon, eſpecially God who here is the teſtator, cannot at one and the ſame time have two different Wills or teſtaments in force. But the laſt and neweſt teſtament is alwayes the beſt, and of ſuch force, that it wholly infringeth the former, though the former at the firſt making of it were valid and good; for when a latter teſtament is made, it neceſſarily argueth, that then at that time there is ſome defect or fault in the former, which is amended in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>If therefore the Old Teſtament be ſtill in force,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}The Old not in force,{/NOTE --> or if it be an effect of the Old to juſtifie unto thoſe better promiſes, or <hi>if the right</hi> thereto <hi>come by the Law;</hi> then there had beene no cauſe of making the New Teſtament, and therefore no cauſe why Chriſt ſhould dye, to teſtifie, confirme, and execute it,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}becau&s;e it was faulty{/NOTE --> For if a mans firſt teſtament bee faultleſſe, there can bee no cauſe why hee ſhould
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:62812:160"/>
make a ſecond: becauſe the true cauſe of making a ſecond is to amend ſomething amiſſe in the firſt: but in a thing faultleſſe there can be nothing amiſſe, and therefore ſuch a thing needs no amending. Hence ſayth the Apoſtle, Hebr. 8.7. <hi>If that firſt Teſtament had beene faultleſse, then ſhould no place have beene ſought for the ſecond.</hi>
                        <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}or el&s;e Pauls argument is &s;o,{/NOTE --> But if the two teſtaments of God be in effect all one, (as ſome teach they are) then is the Apoſtles argument ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly fallacious. For then they can have no different effects, but whatſoever is the effect of either, muſt be alſo the effect of the other; then the firſt Teſtament and the laſt muſt equally juſtifie unto the ſame bleſſednes; then <hi>the Right</hi> thereto muſt <hi>come by the Law,</hi>
                        <!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and Chri&s;t dyed with&EOLhyphen;out cau&s;e.{/NOTE --> and conſequently Chriſt dyed without cauſe. For what cauſe could there be, why he ſhould dye for the laſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if the firſt ſtood ſtill in force, and could effect as much as the laſt? But if no diſcreet man will make two teſtaments, that ſhall be both wholly to one and the ſame effect; (for there can be no cauſe of his ſo doing) much leſſe may we imagine this to be done of the moſt wiſe God.</p>
                     <p n="2"><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Arguments of Gods grace{/NOTE -->2. <hi>In that theſe cauſes were conſequent and ſuitable to the love and grace of God.</hi> When I was a poore miſerable creature in the ſtate of a grievous tranſgreſſor, who had offended againſt the Law of God; in the ſtate of an improbous ſinner who was peccant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rules of naturall equity; in the ſtate of a calamitous ſinner, who was blemiſhed as an alien and ſtranger to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, diſtreſſed and abandoned to all the miſeries of this life, tainted in the attainder of Adams ſin, and borne condemned to eternall death; was it not an argument of Gods love and grace,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}for the Ef&EOLhyphen;fect of it,{/NOTE --> that he would ſo far pleaſe to caſt his eye upon me, as to Juſtifie me, by releaſing, and freeing me from my ſtate of ſinne and death, and by giving me beſides a preſent right of alliance and inheritance with him, to be his Son and Heire to eternall bleſſednes? Was it not an argument of his love and grace to me, that he would juſtifie me upon the condition of holineſſe? For ſeeing he juſtified me to be his Son and Heire; was it not reaſon I ſhould carry my ſelfe as his Son and Heire, in the wayes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, anſwerable to the holineſſe of my heavenly Father? For could it ſtand with the wiſedome and holineſſe of God to require any leſſe condition of me, then to walk worthy of his love and grace towards me?</p>
                     <p><!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and the Meanes,{/NOTE -->And was it not an argument of his further love and grace, that he would make my Juſtification to be Teſtamentary, to convey this Right unto me by his laſt Will and Teſtament, wherein by way of Legacy he predeſtinated and deviſed it unto me? For can any conveyance of any eſtate be more firme and ſure, then that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62812:160"/>
which is ſetled by the meanes of a Teſtament, an inſtrument which naturally requireth all favourable conſtruction, that things may take effect according to the beſt meaning of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator? And was it not the richneſſe of Gods grace,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}which was Rich,{/NOTE --> that hee would ſettle this Teſtament by the death of Chriſt, who was his owne and onely ſon, whom he made his ſubſtitute to dye in his ſtead, for the teſtifying, confirming, and executing of his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it might be in force and take effect, whereby I might finally enjoy the benefit of it? For could not God have ſetled his Teſtament by meanes leſſe chargeable and coſtly to him, then the precious bloud of his owne Son? And laſtly this richnes and abundance of grace, was it not <hi>grace</hi> onely <hi>for grace,</hi> onely for my thankes? <hi>i. e.</hi> onely for my fayth to accept the preſent right to it, for my hope to expect the future poſſeſſion of it, and for my love to performe the condition of it?</p>
                     <p>For is not the richneſſe of this grace abundant enough to draw theſe thankes from mee?<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}Requiring my Faith,{/NOTE --> Is it not rich enough to perſwade my faith to accept the preſent right to my Legacy, and to embrace it with all my heart, and all my ſoule? Seeing Chriſt hath dyed to teſtifie, confirme, and execute that Teſtament, wherein it is deviſed unto mee? For is faith to bee given to any thing which I have not ſeene, if this bee not credible, and to bee belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Is not this grace rich enough to aſſure my hope,<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}and Hope,{/NOTE --> to receive the future poſſeſſion of my Legacy? for when the Executor of the Teſtament ſo loved mee, that hee dyed for my ſake, that the Will might bee in force for which hee dyed; can I imagine that hee will deny mee my Legacy? For what will not hee give me, who gave himſelfe for mee? When the Executor ſitteth at the right hand of the Teſtator upon his Throne in Heaven, where he hath all honour and power to doe all things; can I imagine that hee can bee either unwilling or unable to performe the whole Will of the Teſtator? For will ſuch an Executor in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wrong the Teſtator, or defraud any Legatary, who is co-heire with him?

                     <p>If therefore I conceive that this grace of God comes to mee by the Law, and claime my right to it by the Law:<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}It comes not by the Law,{/NOTE --> Doe I not heereby wave the death of Chriſt, and ſuppoſe that hee dyed without a cauſe, that there was no neede of his death, to teſtifie,

confirme, and execute the New Teſtament? And conſequently, doe I not heereby fruſtrate the grace of God, and diſanul the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious meanes whereby it was conveyed, and finally debarre my ſelfe from the benefit of it? For what right have I to this grace of God, if that Teſtament wherein it is deviſed unto mee, bee of no force, and have no effect? For what force or effect can any Teſtament have which is not teſtified, confirmed, and executed? But contrarily if I meane that Gods grace ſhall bee effectuall, and will hope to enjoy the bleſſing of it, I muſt acknowledge the gracious meanes whereby it was conveyed unto mee; namely, through the death of Chriſt, who ſhed his pretious blood to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, confirme, and execute that Teſtament wherein it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed.<!-- NOTE PLACE="marg"}but is oppo&EOLhyphen;&s;ed to it.{/NOTE --> For this grace was not given by meanes of the Law, but it came by the meanes of Jeſus Chriſt, John 1.17. <hi>For the Law was given by Moſes: But grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hence the New Teſtament is called, the Goſpel of the grace of God, Act. 20.24. <hi>So that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Gospel of the grace of God.</hi> And afterward it is called the word of his grace, in the ſame Chapter, verſ. 32. <hi>And now brethren I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace.</hi> But unto the Law grace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for they are things in themſelves oppoſite, Rom. 6.14. <hi>Yee are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi> Thus the cauſes of Chriſts death were repugnant to the effect of the Law; and were conſequent to the effects of Gods Love and Grace.</p>
